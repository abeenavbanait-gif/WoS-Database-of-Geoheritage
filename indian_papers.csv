Geoheritage, geoconservation, and geotourism studies are gaining interest worldwide because of their scientific, academic, historical, societal, cultural, and esthetic values. Several countries have their government policy to look after the geoheritage sites and conserve with the help of local agencies; however, in India, the concept is still to be applied in a holistic way, and there is a need of such national legislation. Kutch basin as a whole preserves the records of sedimentation for the past similar to 200 Ma. The Cenozoic (last 65 Ma.) sedimentation (similar to 900 m) is considered a strato-type section for the shallow-marine sedimentary records in India. Some Cenozoic sections of Kutch are the only remained reference sections of the respective periods on the globe. This sedimentary succession acts as a geological museum for paleontology, stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and sequence stratigraphy. Such records of past climates and sea-level fluctuations are characterizing the global sea-level history. It also provides an outcrop analog for reservoir rocks of Bombay High oil field. Taking this into account, we propose seven selected sites in the Cenozoic succession to be preserved as geoheritage sites and development of geotourism in the region viz. Matanomadh cliff section, Naredi cliff section, Fulra limestone section, Miocene succession, Paleosol of Sandhan Formation, Kharai River paraconformity section, and Bermoti River section. The advantage of a geopark comprises also in creating new employment opportunities for local youths. Further, it will help enhance the local economy by infrastructure development, health, and educational pursuits to the village-level society. The prime objective of this investigation is to make local people aware about sustainable mining and insatiable thrust for money that threatens ecologically important sites. The geological records are the consequences of millions of years of processes and are considered precious which require special care. If these records once destroyed will be lost forever and cannot be restored artificially, it is our prime responsibility to transfer the knowledge and geoheritage to future generations.","[Shekhar, Shubhendu; Kumar, Pramod] Univ Delhi, Dept Geol, Ctr Adv Studies, Delhi 110007, India; [Chauhan, Gaurav; Thakkar, M.

The fossil-rich stratigraphy of the Kachchh Basin represents the past 200 million years of geological history from the Jurassic Period to the present day, including through the Neogene Period. Both Mesozoic and Cenozoic sequences are highly fossiliferous with a variety of mega, macro, and micro-fossils, including invertebrate, plant, trace, and vertebrate fossils. Crucially, the Kachchh Rift Basin demonstrates a uniquely well exposed, syn to post-rift tectono-sedimentary sequence formed from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous during the break up of Eastern Gondwanaland. The basin is bounded by reactivated primary faults forming tilted horsts and half-grabens. Tilted-up edges of the uplifted fault blocks are represented by uplifted hilly ranges, whereas the intervening subsiding blocks are the geomorphological expression of the low-lying Rann and Banni plains (mudflats, marshes, and grassland). This activity was followed by an inversion cycle initiated in Late Early Cretaceous following the aborting of the rift and is active in the present neotectonic cycle. Thick Deccan Trap lava flows and basic intrusive bodies indicate associated deeper crustal and mantle processes associated with this rift basin evolution. Easily accessed, well-exposed continuous sedimentary sequences with scanty vegetation provide a unique window of opportunity to looking into the geological past of this unique landscape which has preserved the evidence of the evolution of life both in near shore, coastal, and terrestrial environment, as well as a rare opportunity to understand a history of syn/post-rift-fill sedimentation, volcanism, and tectono-geomorphical evolution. More recently the terrain has become a hotspot amongst the planetary scientists as it provides a terrestrial analogue for Lunar and Martian landscapes. These and many other features justify why the unique geological heritage of the Kachchh Basin should be conserved for posterity not only for geoscientists from all over the world but also for local communities and visitors who could learn from its 200 million year history. We therefore propose that the landscapes of the Kachchh Basin should be conserved as a National Geopark in India to achieve such ambitions, and we believe that in this, they have an immense potential to achieve many of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. It is proposed to create 9 geo-stations (for administration) and 75 geosites grouped under these stations within the proposed Kachchh Geopark.","[Chauhan, Gaurav; Thakkar, M.

Volcanic areas (whether active, dormant, or extinct) are exciting targets for such studies. Mid-sixth century rockcut caves in Deccan basalt on the island of Elephanta, in the Mumbai harbour, are the finest in western India. The Elephanta Caves contain exquisite religious sculptures related to the Hindu god Shiva. They are a protected monument of the Archaeological Survey of India and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but no geological-volcanological account of them exists. Here, we illustrate typical and well-exposed hummocky pahoehoe lava flows with three-tiered flow lobes and toes, upper crustal vesicular banding and pipe vesicles along lobe bases, and tumuli with inflation clefts and squeeze-ups, from the Elephanta Caves monument. The field observations and simple calculations indicate formation by endogenous growth (inflation), as for pahoehoe flows in Hawaii and Iceland. Interestingly, despite differences in flow volumes of orders of magnitude between Hawaiian, Icelandic, and Deccan flows, their morphologies, internal structures, and even the scale of these structures are identical. We interpret this as indicating similarly low effusion-rate but much longerlasting eruptions for the Deccan compared to the other two. We show that the Elephanta Caves, a world-renowned historical, artistic, and religious monument, are also a monument for geology and volcanology, and therefore, the need for their conservation is even greater.","[Sheth, Hetu; Patel, Vanit; D'Souza, Joseph] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Samant, Hrishikesh] St Xaviers Coll, Dept Geol, Mumbai 400001, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; St. Xavier's College Mumbai,"Sheth, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India.",hcsheth@iitb.ac.in,"D'Souza, Joseph/NGS-1499-2025; Samant, Hrishikesh/GVS-1920-2022","D'Souza, Joseph/0000-0003-4623-0541; Samant, Hrishikesh/0000-0003-3995-6977",,,,,57,43,45,2,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,SEP,2017,9,3,,,,,359,372,,10.1007/s12371-016-0214-z,0.0,,,14,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,FD5QS,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:000407585500008,0,india

MIS is the third largest, felsic, anorogenic, and terrestrial volcanic province of the world that witnessed Pan African orogeny related to the splitting of Rodinia Supercontinent. Unique and rare volcanic features of MIS at MGR have been declared as the National Geological Monuments of India with its interface with JG. The suite of fluvio-deltaic to coastal sediments of JG at MGR preserved text book style sedimentary structures with rich assemblage of oldest and complex Ediacaran fossils. MIS and JG altogether at MGR constitute the strato-type sections and outdoor geological museums in India that display geological processes of about 200 million years of Earth's history. Such records of past tectonics, climates, and environments characterize the land-sea interaction and distribution in this part of Eastern Gondwana land that represent global geodiversity and provide eminent narratives for geo-education. However, these relict volcanic and sedimentary Georesources though formed site-specific landforms of MGR but have received less attention towards their geoheritage values. MGR is also endowed with many archaeological heritage monuments (HM) with additional cultural values that are constructed by indigenous Heritage Stone Resources (HSR) of JG. The HM represents old patronage of Jodhpur since medieval time that makes it a famous tourist destination of the world. In absence of geotourism applications and infrastructures in India, efforts are made under present study to provide suitable qualitative methodologies to identify geosites and assess geoheritage of educational and geotourism values taking MGR as a case study. Based on the proposed methodologies, we propose twelve geosites of geological, geomorphological, and archaeological types of geoheritage at MGR. These significant geosites of the Cryogenian-Ediacaran successions should be conserved as important geoheritage sites for geotourism through the proposed Geopark at MGR in Jodhpur.","[Saurabh, Mathur; Sudhanshu, Sharma; Singh, S.

The Basin represents highly rugged terrain in the form of the hilly ranges and pediment surfaces, while the flat terrain in the north is expressed by the low-lying Rann and Banni plains (mudflats, marshes, and grassland). This basin has preserved several classical terrestrial analog sites to study planetary science. Several potential localities in the basin provide opportunities to explore as Martian analogs. In the present study, we have proposed five analog sites from the Kachchh basin that has preserved classical geomorphic feature (volcanic and impact craters) as well as minerals (primary phyllosilicates, secondary hydrous sulfates, precipitated iron minerals, evaporite, and liquid brines like perchlorates) that tell the tale of the geological activity taken place on the Mars. The cultural and ecological aspects of the proposed sites and their hinterland are also discussed for the tourist attraction All the proposed sites have ample geoheritage potential and need strong attention for conservation. Further, the establishment of geoparks and development of geotourism in the proposed area will enhance the Earth and Planetary Sciences scenario apart from boosting of local economy, including helping activities, research funding, and employment opportunities for locals that will play a significant role in the economic development of the region. To achieve such an ambitious program and accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals, these locations should be conserved and extended for geotourism.","[Chavan, Anil; Sarkar, Subham; Thakkar, Adarsh; Solanki, Jaymeet; Jani, Chirag; Bhandari, Subhash; Chauhan, Gaurav; Thakkar, M.

The fall model in the present study accounts both spring seepage and wave action, resulting in undercutting and this fall affects only the topmost laterite and the just below sandstone in the cliff. Slippage in this area affects all the litho-units and hence the geologic characteristics of all the litho-units are considered for developing the slippage model. This mathematically derived model can be used in other cliffs exhibiting the same morphology as well as the one controlled by the same influencing factors. This model differs from other models in incorporating multi-lithounits as well as multi-notches. Varkala cliffs form a part of the aspiring geopark in the Global Geopark Network and hence a study on the cliff recession is a pressing requirement.

The use of these geosites for science education, particularly earth science education, to foster sustainable thinking and learn geology and geo-conservation has gained importance over the last few years. Ancient mine workings are one such locality that can be used for teaching geosciences and sustainability issues. Therefore, we propose a field structural geology museum situated in an abandoned Shivrajpur - Bhat manganese mine, located near Champaner - Archaeological Park, UNESCO - World Heritage Site, Gujarat, Western India. The present location has the potential to emerge as a Geo-Heritage site as it consists of (i) more than 200 magnificent, mega-to-mesoscale folded metasedimentary outcrops of open-to-tight isoclinal variety and all S, Z, and M types of ptygmatic fold trains; (ii) classical historical remnants of human-derived underground mining structures, such as vertical shafts, inclines, blind shafts; and (iii) some of the textbook examples of structurally controlled mineralization in rocks as well as guides to metallic ore, e.g. fissure veins, box-works, saddle reefs. This site can provide field experience for understanding geology related to the development of complex structural features and their evolution, mine planning, and management, understanding the effect of mining on the environment, and thinking of necessary remedial measures for the future.","[Joshi, Aditya U.] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India; [Gorania, Parita; Limaye, Manoj A.] Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Dept Geol, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India; [Chauhan, Gaurav D.; Thakkar, M.

As a result, the global initiatives, reinforced by the efforts of the regional and local geological communities, have led to a paradigm shift in how geodiversity (diverse geological elements) and geoheritage (geological heritage) are perceived. The efforts and actions of some nations in conserving geodiversity and geoheritage have been exemplary, while others are still in a nascent stage and a few still need to awaken. The concepts of geodiversity, geoparks, geoheritage, and geoconservation are the fruits of the efforts of many global and regional organizations. The collective efforts of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Global Geoparks Network (GGN), and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) have brought the attention of the global geoscientific community, policymakers and governments of almost all nations to ponder the issues of geodiversity and geoheritage. These globally recognised organisations have been at the forefront and their initiatives have permitted the conservation of some significant geological heritage and have demonstrated that they can pave a new path for more sustainable development. These organisations have worked in tandem for the past few decades and have been successful in identifying and designating some of the outstanding and geologically significant sites/geosites as 'Natural World Heritage Sites', 'UNESCO Global Geoparks'. The novel ideas and statutes defining global designation criteria and protocols by these organisations are there to enthuse and encourage earth scientists, policymakers, the public, and governments of all nations to frame their own national and local statutes for the identification and conservation of outstanding national geoheritage and to further integrate them with the international organisations for global designations.","[Kaur, Gurmeet] Panjab Univ, Dept Geol, Chandigarh 160014, India",Panjab University,"Kaur, G (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Dept Geol, Chandigarh 160014, India.",gurmeet28374@gmail.com,"Kaur, Gurmeet/CAF-3143-2022","Kaur, Gurmeet/0000-0001-5002-544X",,,,,30,17,19,1,14,GEOLOGICAL SOC INDIA,BANGALORE,"NO 63, 12TH CORSS, BASAPPA LAY OUT, GAVIPURAM PO, PO BOX 1922, BANGALORE, 560-019, INDIA",0016-7622,0974-6889,,J GEOL SOC INDIA,J.

These abiotic elements are characterised by their intrinsic scientific value-independent of scenic and visual beauty. These geosites have immense educational, aesthetic, cultural and economic values through tourism, low-impact recreational and leisure activities. There is natural potential for developing into geoparks in the Jaisalmer Basin that has been emphasised in this paper on unique fossils, fossiliferous horizons and stratigraphic markers, such as the Akal National Park or Akal Wood Fossils Park; Thaiyat Scarp section near Thaiyat village; Bada Bag section and Kuldhar River section; arid and hyper-arid desert geomorphic sculptures and evolving landscapes and ecosystems conserving the distinguishing biodiversity together with the cultural and historical heritage of west Rajasthan, India. The scientifically researched robust details on several rare geosites are documented for their unique geoscientific significance, comprehensive geoconservation efforts and promotion of knowledge-based geotourism leading to the creation of suitably managed Jaisalmer Geopark and sustainable growth of the local communities.

One of the most impressive rock formations is the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) section. This section exhibits potentially essential information about the character and causes of the Late Permian mass extinction. Likewise, the jointed nature of the Panjal volcanics and the uplift associated with the Himalayan tectonics have resulted in the characteristic relief responsible for the development of waterfalls. The picturesque waterfall, known as Aharbal waterfall, has emerged as one of the best tourist hotspots on the Vishav River. The Karewa deposits witnessed many human civilizations and habitations besides being bystanders to the climatic record of the last 4 million years. Also, the loess-paleosol sequences, low and high-altitude lakes, karst landscape, and glacier geomorphic features impart scenic beauty to the valley.

Each year, millions of tourists visit archaeological locations across the globe. Ancient civilizations are often shrouded in mystery due to the limited data available from archaeological structures. Allied sciences like geology have been of tremendous assistance in understanding the relationship between man and the environment. The Kachchh region is home to several sites of the Indus Civilization (also known as the Harappan Civilization). Due to its geological setting, Kachchh also has unique structural, geomorphological, petrological, paleontological and archaeological attributes. Therefore, the region attracts the attention of geologists, archaeologists and tourists alike. The present study describes Harappan sites in Kachchh which have been proposed as potential locations for geoarchaeological tourism. Since UNESCO World Heritage archaeological sites like Dholavira are already popular with tourists, it acts as an impetus for geotourism and geoarchaeological research.

Going by the vast geodiversity in India, the declared geoheritage sites are far less and thus, there is a scope to recognize and develop more across the country. The Karnataka State in southern India with rocks and landforms of antiquity offers one of the excellent provinces for recognizing geoheritage sites. Here, spectacular structural, textural, geomorphological and ancient life-form features have been studied and mapped and they could be sites of educational, scientific, research, and esthetic values, besides tourist attraction. Steep fault gorges in Sandur, lofty granite massifs in Ramanagara, natural rocky sculptures in Mudgal, abandoned open cast iron ore mines amid outstanding scenic beauty in Kudremukh, typical spinifex textures in the Archaean ultramafic lavas in Banasandra and Gattihosahalli and stromatolitic structures in Chitradurga schist belt are some of the excellent features worth declaring as geoheritage sites, which could add to the existing list of 4 such sites already declared and protected in the State. Most of the sites which are being proposed now are in mining/quarrying areas and need urgent attention for their conservation. Some of them are already facing irreversible damage and therefore it is time that their scientific value is realized and conserved. SWOT analysis has been carried out for these sites and strategies recommended by analyzing the TOWS matrix for their conservation. It is recommended that the Geological Survey of India (GSI) in coordination with the State Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) should play a key role in this endeavor with assistance from academic Institutions, Private Exploration Companies, NGOs, and individual geoscience professionals. The Government should appoint geoscience representatives on the Boards meant to draw policies on nature conservation. The fund available in District Mineral Foundation, collected as a share of the royalty for mineral mining, could be utilized to protect and maintain the identified geoheritage sites in the respective districts of the State.","[Prabhakar, B.

This study investigates Zanskar's geoheritage and cultural geomorphology, highlighting its importance for geotourism and advocating for the implementation of sustainable development to preserve its fragile ecosystem. Flowing northward from the Higher Himalayas, the Zanskar River, one of the largest northeast-flowing tributary of the Upper Indus River Basin (UIRB), traverses the complex, strongly folded, and thrusted Zanskar Range via a steep, narrow 60-kilometer-long gorge. Zanskar has consistently garnered attention from geoscientists and tourists owing to its unique geographic location and remoteness. Many areas and routes in Zanskar are challenging to reach, but it stands out as a prime location where glaciers can be accessed by road, making it an ideal destination for studying geoscience. Geologically, the study area is part of the Zanskar Range, with its boundaries defined by the Ladakh Range to the northeast and the Great Himalayan Range to the southwest. The Indus Tsangpo Suture Zone, the Tethyan Sedimentary Sequence, and the Higher Himalayan Crystalline Sequence are exposed from north to south. Zanskar serves as a pristine field museum for studying young Himalayan orogenic tectonics, featuring prominent exposures such as the Zanskar Shear Zone (ZSZ)/South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) and the structural outcrop of Zangla, showcasing a variety of folding types. These folds signify different phases of deformation resulting from the Indo-Eurasian collision. Moreover, it serves as a prime sequence of Quaternary Glacial Periods (QGP), providing an ideal natural laboratory and an open, practical classroom for geoscientists and Earth science students. We propose ten geoheritage sites in Zanskar, which encompass cultural, geomorphological, and geological attractions with potential for geotourism in this region.","[Irfan, Mohammad; Mir, Sareer Ahmad; Bali, Bikram Singh; Afzal, Ahsan; Bhat, Naseer Ahmad; Bhat, Nayeem; Bashir, Asif; Nazir, Muskan] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar, J&k, India",University of Kashmir,"Irfan, M; Bali, BS (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar, J&k, India.",irfanwani1506@gmail.com; baligeol@uok.edu.in,"Irfan, Mohammad/LZF-3839-2025; Wani, Ahsan/AAX-5462-2021; Bashir, Asif/M-3961-2013; Bhat, Naseer/AAE-8476-2020","Irfan, Mohammad/0009-0008-5459-1025;",,,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the Department of Earth Sci-ences, University of Kashmir, for providing the lab facilities, and extend special thanks to the Head of the Department for their encouragement and support.

We discuss a few Quaternary geosites of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh, NW Indian territories, as these are from the present and the ongoing period of Earth's history - the Quaternary Period and it is already under a threat. These sites are a treasure trove of information on the geomorphology, landscape evolution, palaeoclimate, palaeoecology, and neotectonics of this recent period. These can prove very helpful in understanding of climate change, hydroclimate, ecology, mountain geomorphology, etc., of this important part of the Third Pole apart from geotourism which attracts over a million tourists every year to these beautiful Himalayan states of India. To cater the floating population, the construction activities have been taking a toll of these sites and the mysteries in their records are being depleted. Erosion, mining, agriculture, urbanization, and industries are causing major harm to them. These geosites are having great Geotourism potential which can prove helpful in enhancing the socio-economic status of local population. In no time, several of these sites will be replaced by modern day construction, and hence, it needs a necessitate protection.","[Verma, Shirish; Phartiyal, Binita] Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Verma, Shirish; Phartiyal, Binita] Acad Sci & Innovat Res, Ghaziabad 201002, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Chandra, Rakesh] Ladakh Univ, Dept Geol, Leh 194101, Ladakh, India",Department of Science & Technology (India); Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR),"Phartiyal, B (corresponding author), Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Phartiyal, B (corresponding author), Acad Sci & Innovat Res, Ghaziabad 201002, Uttar Pradesh, India.",binita_phartiyal@bsip.res.in,"; Chana, Rakesh/AFJ-0185-2022","Phartiyal, Binita/0000-0003-3086-8735; Chana, Rakesh/0000-0003-4956-0319","Kashmir University Leh, Ladakh","Kashmir University Leh, Ladakh","Director, Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, is thanked for the encouragement (BSIP/RDCC/94/2021-2022).

The important proposed landforms for geomorphosites from the Chambal River are (a) Badland topography (GSB): Chambal Badlands are severely dissected, difficult to transverse, and unsuitable for agriculture; (b) Canyons of Chambal (GSC): Canyons of Chambal River are one of the largest in India; and (c) Waterfalls and rapids: The middle reaches of the Chambal River consist of waterfalls, known as Chulia, and contain large boulders, potholes, and step-pool sections. For the present study, the M-GAM method was applied for geomorphosite assessment of the selected sites in order to establish their potential to become geomorphological sites. Canyons, waterfalls, and badlands are all highly rated geomorphosites. Badlands receive the highest ranking because they are excellent examples of geomorphological processes. Canyons and waterfalls are the most accessible. However, The badlands are the most difficult to access. For each geosite, additional functional values are very low. Canyons and waterfalls are popular tourist destinations. Tour guide service is one of the most highly valued aspects for tourists. This is essential during the current COVID-19 pandemic, when international travel is restricted, resulting in a surge in domestic tourists to nature destinations. Major improvements to the low-rated elements, coupled with better promotional activities, would offer more domestic and international tourists to these geosites, benefiting the local population and economy through higher income and new jobs.","[Resmi, M.

It is a worldwide endeavour to locate and preserve geological heritage for educational, tourism and conservation objectives. The Kachchh Basin is universally acknowledged in India for its rich palaeontological treasures of the southern Tethys margin. Several outcrops of low-dipping Mesozoic strata provide valuable information about the area's geological history. Since many decades, national and international students of earth sciences, geomorphology, geophysics, petroleum and reservoir engineering and mineral exploration have visited the Kachchh Basin for educational and training purposes. The basin reveals exceptional outcrops bearing evidence of Mesozoic life and its evolutionary fingerprints. The outcropping Cretaceous sediments of the basin extend offshore, producing economic quantities of hydrocarbons. Thus, it has become essential to preserve and protect Cretaceous sedimentary sequences for teaching and training purposes. We have identified three important geoheritage locations that should be preserved for the future. These three sites are (a) Tapkeshwari ichnosites, (b) Hill Garden ichnosites and (c) Ghuneri Dome ichnosite. The selected geoheritage sites displayed lateral stratigraphical continuity, outstanding textbook-type examples of (a) different trace fossil assemblages, (b) physical sedimentary structures and (c) dual-porosity petrophysical characteristics. Therefore, these sites offer a unique opportunity to study the wave-dominated deltaic ichnology of the Cretaceous clastic sequence and the effect of bioturbation on the petrophysical parameters.","[Chauhan, Suruchi; Desai, Bhawanisingh] Pandit Deendayal Energy Univ, Sch Energy Technol, Dept Petr Engn, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India",Pandit Deendayal Energy University,"Desai, B (corresponding author), Pandit Deendayal Energy Univ, Sch Energy Technol, Dept Petr Engn, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.",bhawanigd@gmail.com,"Desai, Bhawanisingh/V-9038-2019","Chauhan, Suruchi/0000-0002-9614-9920","School of Petroleum Technology, Pandit Deendayal Energy University","School of Petroleum Technology, Pandit Deendayal Energy University","The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr Suraj Bhosle for his help in the field.

In addition, it deals with the heritage, diversity, and conservation of such places through appreciation and learning. India and particularly, the Ladakh region possess a rich number of sites of physiographic, geological, and cultural importance. The region is famous for varied rock types, tectonic structures, minerals, and geological history ranging from the Achaean (3.5 billion years BP) to the Recent (10,000 years BP). Geotourism plays a vital role in exposing and connecting an area of geological importance to the rest of the world. In the present work, some geological sites of the Leh district of Ladakh India, which are significant to understanding the formation of the subcontinent, the evolution of the mighty Himalayan mountain range, the fate of the Tethys Ocean, and past tectonic and climatic conditions of the region, have been described. These sites include U-shaped valleys of Umla, Taru, and Phyang, the oldest Indus valley moraines stretching along the left side of the Leh-Kargil highway near Pathar Sahib-Taru-Phyang area, syn- and post plutonic dykes Taru-Phyang, paleolake deposits of Spituk and Lamayuru, post-collision Indus molasse deposits near Hemis, pre-collision flysch deposits of Lamayuru, hot springs of Puga, Chumathang, and Panamik, zebra stripe pattern Leucocratic granites of Chumathang, Nidar Ophiolite suite, and Hunder sand dunes.

The most of the area and routes are not easily accessible but it is the place where the glaciers are accessible by road and hence the best place for the study on glacial geomorphology and geology. Geologically, it represents the northwestern extension of the Spiti Basin, and constitutes the southern part of the Ladakh Himalaya. This range lies between the Great Himalayan and Ladakh ranges from SW and NE. It exposes the Higher Himalayan Crystalline (HHC), Paleo-Mesozoic Tethyan Sequences, and Indus Suture Zone composed of Kargil Mollase, flysch, and ophiolitic melange. It is an ideal field museum of young orogenic tectonic and lithological settings and faunal remains from Cambrian onwards. Sediments of the Zanskar Range show sub-vertically, tightly folded, and wedge type structures in the north and open to tight folds in the south. In the present study, we have revealed the geoheritage value of each of its exposures taking the field, areal-air, and Google traverses from Kargil to Zangla along the Suru, Shankoo, Doda, and Zanskar valleys and air traverse from Leh to Lesser Himalaya of Kashmir. It is also an ideal sequence of Quaternary glacial episodes, the natural laboratory, and the open practical school for earth scientists. Eleven geoheritage sites are proposed in the Zanskar region with several geotopes under each site, covering many potential sites of this region.

The largest and finest are the Ajanta Caves (second century B.C. to seventh century A.D.), famous for their Buddhist religious sculptures and murals, and the Ellora Caves (fifth to eleventh centuries A.D.), equally famous for their Hindu, Buddhist and Jain religious sculptures. Both sites are protected monuments of the Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and extensive studies of their architectural and artistic heritage exist. However, no detailed geological-volcanological account of these monuments exists in the Deccan Traps literature, except for brief mentions of their well-developed compound pahoehoe lava flows. This paper documents the well-exposed stacking geometry of these lava flows, compound at various size scales, and their internal structures. The latter include a three-tier division into upper crust, core and lower crust, basal pipe vesicles, upper crustal vesicular banding, ropy surfaces, and lobes and tumuli with tensional inflation clefts which sometimes produced lava squeeze-ups and were commonly filled by younger lava. The lava flows are thus hummocky pahoehoe, like many modern basaltic lava flows of Kilauea. They may be distal parts of the same lava flows or flow fields which are represented by sheet lobes in proximal (near-vent) areas. The Ajanta and Ellora Caves, world-renowned historical, cultural, religious and artistic monuments and ancient rock-engineering marvels, are also monuments for flood basalt geology and volcanology and ancient volcanic geoheritage.","[Sheth, Hetu] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Mumbai 400076, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Sheth, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Mumbai 400076, India.",hcsheth@iitb.ac.in,,,,,,,86,8,9,2,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,MAR,2023,15,1,,,,,,,39,10.1007/s12371-023-00809-w,0.0,,,21,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,9N7XI,,Bronze,,,2026-02-01,WOS:000943124800001,0,india

Known as the Ramgarh (impact) structure, this landform was first noticed in 1869. Although the possibility of its meteorite impact origin was mentioned as early as 1972, it was described as a tectonic dome structure, in the absence of any clinching evidence. Geological and geophysical investigations carried out during the last decades have pointed out features typical of a terrestrial meteorite impact, such as a well-preserved circular shape with an uplifted central depression, steep inner slopes of the ridge compared to outer slopes, intense brecciation, fracturing, and faulting, and most important, identification of planar deformation features in quartz, diagnostic of shock metamorphism. Therefore, the structure has recently been recognized as a confirmed meteorite impact structure from India and listed in the global database on impact structures. The central depression of the structure is also the site for a tenth century Khajuraho-style temple complex. Besides, there are two cave temples on the inner slope of the eastern rim of the structure, a cultural cum pilgrimage center. The ruins of a fort at the southern outer slope of the structure represent yet another object of archeological/historic interest. The two water bodies in the central depression, filled with the rainwater drained from the surrounding slopes, are the abode for several species of migratory birds. Thus, the impact structure provides scientific, archeological, historical, cultural, and biodiversity features of common interest in a unified geographic domain, making an appropriate case for consideration and accreditation as geopark. Although the structure is listed amongst 34 geoheritage sites/geological monuments by the Geological Survey of India, the efforts have not been translated into any action on the ground in terms of developing it as a geopark. In this contribution, we provide geological and geomorphological characteristics of this structure, and in conjunction with the other wide-ranging aspects, propose recognition of this well-preserved meteorite impact structure as a geoheritage site/geopark.","[Pandit, Manoj K.] Univ Rajasthan, Dept Geol, Jaipur 302004, Rajasthan, India; [Master, Sharad] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geosci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Rajasthan; University of Witwatersrand,"Pandit, MK (corresponding author), Univ Rajasthan, Dept Geol, Jaipur 302004, Rajasthan, India.",manoj.pandit@gmail.com,,,,,,,127,8,8,1,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,SEP,2021,13,3,,,,,,,81,10.1007/s12371-021-00601-8,0.0,,,16,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,UI9MR,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:000690922000001,0,india

Landscape development is influenced by landslide phenomenon and depends upon geomorphic processes and geomorphodiversity (GmD). It is linked intimately with geomorphology, hydrology and soil type. This study uses a remote sensing and GIS-based approach to assess the spatial linkage between GmD and landslide distribution in Meghalaya (India). GmD index (GmDI) is developed using geological, morphometric and geomorphological parameters and analysed with landslide distribution. The landslide distribution considering land use/cover change (LUCC) is also examined. The result shows that the region with high-relief, valley and depression zone, mainly along the Dauki fault, have a high to a very high GmDI. About 61% of landslide localities are in zones of high GmDI, concentrated in the central and eastern parts of Meghalaya. Density analysis of the very high class (class 5) of GmD confirms the same. Most of these landslides occur in dense and light-vegetated landmasses. However, the LUCC analysis reveals a significant increase in the built area on steeper slopes (average expansion ratio of 2.30 for slopes >15(degrees)) between 2017 and 2022, indicating a rising threat of landslides in urban areas of Meghalaya. The study presents the importance of GmD in active tectonic regions with particular reference to landslide potential and recent LUCC. It can aid decision-makers in planning sustainable developments and risk mitigation strategies for landslide hazards and geoconservation.","[Agrawal, Navdeep; Dixit, Jagabandhu] Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Delhi Ncr, Uttar Pradesh, India",Shiv Nadar University,"Dixit, J (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Delhi Ncr, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jdixitb@gmail.com,"Dixit, Jagabandhu/AAC-5635-2022; Agrawal, Navdeep/GRX-8105-2022","Dixit, Jagabandhu/0000-0002-5450-578X; Agrawal, Navdeep/0000-0002-4352-4926",,,,,69,7,8,3,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0197-9337,1096-9837,,EARTH SURF PROC LAND,Earth Surf.

The present study describes the geoheritage and geotourism potential of the Kalaruch old workings (ancient mines) and Satbarren (archeological stone) and highlights its significance for preservation, conservation, and sustainable development. These unique structures are of immense geological, archeological, historical, cultural, educational, and scientific importance. Its surroundings with beautiful topography and geomorphic landforms covered with lush green forests possess the marvelous potential for geotourism development. In this area, more than 8 old workings (OWs) clustered along a major quartz vein of strike length similar to 3.5 km (from Madmadou-Lashteal-Lainat Top to Gagarnar) and the average width of similar to 9 m (2-15 m) are present. The quartz vein is hosted within the Lolab Formation of the Lower Cambrian age that represents the oldest lithounits of the Paleozoic succession of the Kashmir Nappe Zone. The Formation shows profuse development of ichno fossils and tentatively marks the Precambrian-Cambrian (P-C) boundary in the area. Prominent sulfide mineralization of pyrite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, malachite, and azurite is present within the main quartz vein, its host rock and on the walls of OWs respectively. Conversely, the Satbarren is an archeological giant slaty rock that is meticulously crafted and half buried in the ground. It comprises 9 shallow carved shelves (doors) that do not represent any distinct route to Russia and other neighboring countries as commonly believed. However, the Kalaruch OWs and Satbarren stone form an important geo-archeological artifact that indicates ancient mining activities by early civilization probably during similar to 3300-1000 BC in the area. Therefore, developing this place as a geoheritage and geotourism site will help in enhancing the socio-economic status of the local population and conserve it for future geologists, archeologists, researchers, students, and curious tourists. For its geoconservation and sustainable development, certain recommendations are provided in this study.","[Mir, Riyaz Ahmad] Geol Survey India, UTs Jammu & Kashmir & Ladakh, Srinagar 190008, India; [Ahmad, Syed Ajaz] Geol Survey India, SU Rajasthan, Jaipur 302004, India; [Akaram, Vaseem; Kumar, Vinod] Geol Survey India, UTs Jammu & Kashmir & Ladakh, Jammu 180004, India",Geological Survey India; Geological Survey India; Geological Survey India,"Mir, RA (corresponding author), Geol Survey India, UTs Jammu & Kashmir & Ladakh, Srinagar 190008, India.",udfriyaz@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,7,7,2,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,JUN,2023,15,2,,,,,,,43,10.1007/s12371-023-00807-y,0.0,,,24,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,9V4EQ,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:000948348100001,0,india

The crater, though scoured in a basaltic terrain, is still preserved in its most pristine form, with a central crater lake. The geomorphology, geochemistry, geochronology, hydrology, geophysical parameters, and structural aspects of Lonar Crater have been explored in detail, but still continue to contribute valid scientific insights into the geology of terrestrial impact craters. Lonar serves as a potential analog site for studying impact cratering on planetary surfaces with basaltic terrains such as the Moon and Mars. Besides being a highly recognizable impact crater in India, the Lonar crater and its hinterland stand out with its archeological relevance and spiritual influence among the people. The numerous temples in and around the crater premises uphold the cultural significance of the region. The crater and adjacent areas are rich in flora and fauna representing a diverse ecosystem in the vastness of the arid Deccan Flood Basalts. Hence, the astrobleme and its surrounding is declared a Ramsar site and is also a protected wildlife sanctuary. The Indian Government has also declared the crater a National Geological Monument as well as an archaeological monument. Furthermore, the astrobleme is a unique site with sociocultural and economic significance. With these plethoras of importance, combined with the geological and socio-cultural aspects in its hinterland, together with the most acclaimed UNESCO world heritage centers Ajantha and Ellora caves in the neighborhood, it stands as the right candidate for a UNESCO Global Geopark. However, the crater and its ecosystem are not preserved well enough, and the uniqueness of the crater is diminishing. But after selection as a Ramsar site, the area shows increased vegetation growth. The SWOT analysis conducted in this study accounts for Lonar Crater and its adjoining areas as a potential global geopark. Thus, through this study, we try to propagate the vivid and myriad importance of the Lonar crater and the necessity of protecting this geological monument from both anthropogenic and natural processes and to appraise the necessity for nominating this area as a UNESCO Global Geopark.","[Chandran, Saranya R.; James, S.; Aswathi, J.; Padmakumar, Devika; Kumar, R.

The Saurashtra (along with Kachchh) region of Gujarat, India, is bestowed with a unique sedimentary formation - the Miliolite Formation that exhibits the land-sea interaction in the form of cliffs, marine terraces, wave-cut platforms and marine notches. This bioclastic carbonate deposit of Saurashtra in particular is repository of the geological processes that operate in the region, during the Middle to Late Pleistocene. These bioclastic carbonate deposits have been studied to reconstruct the paleogeography of the Saurashtra coastline in terms of marine, aeolian and reworked fluvial origins. This work highlights their significance as a geoheritage site and a geomorphosite to study various climate-sea level-tectonic interactions and their importance in promoting geotourism in the region.

Geologically, Kaimur Group comprises six formations (in ascending order) namely Sasaram Sandstone, Ghurma Shale, Markundi Sandstone, Bijaigarh Shale, Scarp Sandstone, and Dhandraul Sandstone. It is quite likely that all the five variants of Kaimur Group sandstones (excluding Bijaigarh Shale) were being utilized by local people as heritage stone at different times in the past. However, Scarp Sandstone and Dhandraul Sandstone formations have been extensively used as building material due to their variegated colours, stratigraphic thickness and wide exposure, low porosity, hardness, compactness, mechanical durability, and high tensile and compressive strength as compared to other variants. These sandstones are commercially known by their trade name - Chunar Sandstone which is locally called as Chunar balua patthar, Balua patthar, Pattiya patthar, and Baad. In 2019, Chunar Balua Patthar was granted GI tag. Chunar Sandstone has been widely used as in situ rock shelters, carved sculptures of deities, in temples, forts, heritage buildings, and monuments and also as art and architectural elements from prehistoric and historic times. This sandstone has been used in ancient and contemporary places of worship of different faiths in eastern and central India, river embankments locally called as ghats in Varanasi and Mirzapur districts, forts and fortresses, bridges, roads, tunnels, educational institutions gardens, and places of public utility. The use of this sandstone is evidenced in one of the oldest divine site for Buddhists, the Maha Bodhi Temple Complex (UNESCO World Heritage Site), located in Bodh Gaya. The National Emblem of India is taken from the Lion capital of Ashoka in Sarnath and is carved from these sandstones.

The scientific and additional values of geomophosites in different parts of the world are continuously being changed or have been changed by several human activities. Now, these changes are either positive or negative or both of them. Therefore, assessment of human impacts on these sites has paramount importance and is pre requisite to develop any kind of geomanagement-related strategies for them. Such type of impact assessment has been termed as Geomorphosite Impact Assessment (GIA) by the authors. In the present work, the authors have developed an innovative way to study the human impacts on a geomorphosite. They have developed a simple matrix named geomatrix following the principles as given by Leopold et al. (1971) with some modifications that shows the interactions or impacts of different human sub-activities on different sub-values of a geosite, plus it has been shown how the proposed matrix can be used as a useful tool to form geomanagement-related strategies for the concerned geosite. The whole work has been conducted on Mama Bhagne Pahar, an appropriate example of granite tor as well as an important geomorphosite in West Bengal, India. Five values along with eighteen sub-values and four groups of human activities along with fourteen sub-activities have been identified in the present geosite. The prepared matrix shows an immense scope of geoeducation, local tourism and geoscientific research in the concerned site. On the other hand, the site has been highly deteriorated by several anthropogenic threats. But, the protection level of the site is negligible. Therefore, in the present work, the authors have also suggested some geomanagement-related strategies under the concept of bottom-up approach for the protection and promotion of the concerned site simultaneously.","[Sarkar, Somnath] Diamond Harbour Womens Univ, Dept Geog, South 24 Parganas, Sarishaw, W Bengal, India",,"Sarkar, S (corresponding author), Diamond Harbour Womens Univ, Dept Geog, South 24 Parganas, Sarishaw, W Bengal, India.",krishanu.geo2016@gmail.com; hetampur.somnathsarkar@gmail.com,,"DATTA, KRISHANU/0000-0001-7195-4774",,,,,55,6,8,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,MAR,2022,14,1,,,,,,,32,10.1007/s12371-022-00668-x,0.0,,,16,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,ZF4YR,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:000759575700001,0,india

This study systematically investigates the geoheritage and cultural geomorphology of Kashmir, aiming to identify and evaluate key geosites with potential for sustainable geotourism development. Located between the Greater Himalayan Range and the Pir Panjal Range, Kashmir exhibits a complex assemblage of lithological units, tectonic structures, and geomorphological features, interwoven with a deep-rooted cultural landscape. Through integrated field-based geological surveys and cultural analyses, the study delineates critical sites of geoheritage importance and quantitatively assesses their geotourism potential based on scientific, educational, and cultural value. By focusing on the connections between natural landscapes and cultural heritage, the findings advocate for geotourism initiatives that promote community engagement, environmental stewardship, and economic sustainability. Kashmir has continually drawn attention from both Earth scientists and visitors due to its unique geographical location. Though its landscapes can be challenging to access, it remains a prime destination where rivers, lakes, historical sites, and glaciers are accessible by road, making it an ideal location for studying geosciences. Structurally, the Kashmir Basin is bounded by the Main Central Thrust to the southwest and the Zanskar Thrust to the northeast, offering a tectonically active setting that facilitates the study of Himalayan deformation. The Balapur Fault exposure provides a rare opportunity for in-situ structural and geomorphological training, while the jointed Panjal Volcanics and associated uplift driven by Himalayan orogeny have developed prominent geomorphic features such as the Panzkoot and Aharbal waterfalls-both of which are ideal for combined geoscientific education and public outreach. These findings underscore the importance of the region as a natural laboratory for understanding orogenic processes, paleoenvironments, and landscape dynamics. Of particular scientific significance is the Permo-Triassic boundary section at Guryul Ravine, which offers an uninterrupted 3-meter stratigraphic record of the end-Permian mass extinction-substantially exceeding the thickness of the globally recognized Meishan section in China. This site holds outstanding potential for nomination as an international geopark due to its stratigraphic completeness and relevance to global biotic and climatic transitions. Collectively, the proposed geosites underscore the Kashmir region's capacity to serve as a strategic geoscientific and geotourism hub. The study provides a novel, interdisciplinary foundation for advancing geoheritage conservation and promoting scientifically-informed, sustainable tourism in tectonically and culturally dynamic mountain environments.","[Irfan, Mohammad; Afzal, Ahsan; Bali, Bikram Singh; Ahmad, Naseer; Bashir, Asif] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Topal, Savas] Pamukkale Univ, Dept Geol Engn, Kinikli Campus, TR-20160 Denizli, Turkiye; [Naik, Sambit] Univ Petr, Dept Petr Engn & Earth Sci & Energy Studies, Dehra Dun 248007, India",University of Kashmir; Pamukkale University; University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES),"Irfan, M; Bali, BS (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar, Jammu And Kashm, India.",irfanwani1506@gmail.com; baligeol@uok.edu.in,"Topal, Savaş/I-1233-2012; Wani, Ahsan/AAX-5462-2021; Bashir, Asif/M-3961-2013; Irfan, Mohammad/LZF-3839-2025","Topal, Savaş/0000-0001-7451-6606; Irfan, Mohammad/0009-0008-5459-1025","Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir","Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir","We sincerely acknowledge the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, for providing lab facilities, and we extend our deepest thanks to the Head of the Department for their constant support and encouragement.

India is bestowed with excellent geological structures, geomorphic features, and rock types varying in age from Archaean to Holocene. Permian Panjal traps (North-west of India) present a first-class hope to understand the multifarious transport of magma from mantle to crust, petrochemical growth of igneous rocks, and the development of ore deposits related to magmatic activity (such as Fe-Ti-V, Cr, Ni-Cu-PGE). These volcanic rocks are important in understanding the evolution of Neotethys ocean. Panjal traps (for being the largest part of the Himalayan Permian magmatic region) would be helpful in understanding the petrogenesis of the Himalayan Permian mafic and silicic magmatic rocks which is debatable at global level. The present study aims to propose the pillow basalts of Panjal traps exposed at Guryul Ravine, Kashmir, as a Geoheritage site. On the bases of length of major axis, studied pillows are grouped into normal class (having < 100-cm length of major axis) and mega class (having > 1 m length of major axis). The formation of undersized pillows having flat surfaces and continuous chilled crusts has been attributed with uniform and restricted stretching of the outer crust. The studied pillows show different shapes like spherical, oval and elongated to irregular and have radial joint patterns which have been filled at later stages by secondary minerals such as calcite and chlorite. Spaces between / among adjacent pillows are occupied by cements of hydrothermal origin and secondary minerals (like chlorite, calcite, and hyaloclastite breccias). The preservation of these pillow basalts of Panjal traps would be highly beneficial to support the evidence of magma eruption under marine environment, magma-water interaction studies, petrological evolution of Panjal traps, and sights related to tectonic setting of the area during the Permo-carboniferous period. Hence, these pillow basalts, in the vicinity of Permian-Triassic boundary section, at Guryul Ravine, form the potential area to be promoted as geo-heritage site.","[Mir, Akhtar R.] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, India",University of Kashmir,"Mir, AR (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, India.",mirakhtar.r@gmail.com,"MIR, AKHTAR Rasool/ABG-6272-2020","MIR, AKHTAR Rasool/0000-0002-9469-7659","University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India; Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology [SR/FTP/ES-4/2014]","University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India; Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology","Author is highly thankful to Head, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India, for providing encouraging environment and facilities during the preparation of this work.

Step wells in India are magnificent groundwater bodies characterized by their greater values of hydrogeological geodiversity. Step wells of Jodhpur situated in the Thar Desert of western India are locally known as Jhalra and Baori which are good practices of ground water harvesting, conservation and management system of medieval period. Furthermore, these are magnificent artefacts showcasing historical-cultural (archeological), Architectural and civil engineering geo-monumental heritage of India. In absence of any methodology and guidelines, the hydrological heritage aspects of step wells are least understood and were not adequately explored for their geoheritage values. The present study explores in light of their potential to characterize and recognize them as hydro-geosites of hydro-geoheritage values to promote hydro-geotourism in India. Thus, based on the proposed methodology, out of 134 inventoried step wells of Jodhpur, eight are selected as hydro-geosites for their characterization to be utilized them for educational and hydro-geotourism purposes. Very less number of qualified hydro-geosites clearly reveals that most of them are in pathetic stage due to their negligence since long time that needs urgent conservation. For their conservation, these hydro-geosites should be protected as an important geoheritage sites similar to National Geological Monument (NGM) and Monument of National Interest (MNI) in India.

Geological outcrops are essential for effective learning and scientific advancement. Crafting educational initiatives centred around essential geological sites carries immense significance. Hence, imparting geological knowledge to future generations becomes paramount by actively safeguarding precious geological sites from irreversible loss. The Kachchh Rift basin holds a wealth of knowledge about Mesozoic sediments, showcasing remarkably well-preserved fossil-rich layers. The notable Jaramara geostation has gained substantial acclaim as a prominent tourist hotspot. Owing to its historical and cultural heritage as a battleground site, referred to as kutch jo Kurukshetra, it attracts significant tourists. Identifying proposed geo-education stations in these tourist sites will improve geo-education for the general public. Promoting this region as a vital geosite serves a dual purpose: preserving and nurturing the area for geoscience enthusiasts while contributing to the local community's growth and development. Since general awareness mainly revolves around Jaramara's cultural aspects, the current work advocates for integrating Jaramara as a Geoeducation station by complimenting 14 additional sites unique to the general public and geoscience professionals. These sites offer an enriching outdoor classroom to grasp the Mesozoic geological history of the Jhurio, Jumara, and Jhuran formations of the Kachchh Basin. Among these sites, the Jaramara cliff stands out with its gracefully curving escarpment and distinct Jara and Jumara domes. This geological wonder exhibits a seamless sequence of the Jhurio, Jumara, and Jhuran Formations. Thus, these sites and the suggested locations are pivotal in unravelling the intricate story of the Mesozoic succession.","[Desai, Bhawanisingh G.; Chaudhary, Anjali; Chauhan, Suruchi; Singh, Ajendra] Pandit Deendayal Energy Univ, Sch Energy Technol, Dept Petr Engn, Raisan, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India",Pandit Deendayal Energy University,"Chauhan, S (corresponding author), Pandit Deendayal Energy Univ, Sch Energy Technol, Dept Petr Engn, Raisan, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.",sur25patel@gmail.com,"Chaudhary, Anjali/GYV-5018-2022; Desai, Bhawanisingh/V-9038-2019","SINGH, AJENA/0000-0002-6226-5624",,,,,62,4,4,0,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,DEC,2023,15,4,,,,,,,135,10.1007/s12371-023-00905-x,0.0,,,16,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,Z5JV4,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:001112445500001,0,india

These are represented by rocks of Malani Igneous Suite (MIS) of Cryogenian age forming basement for overlying Ediacaran Jodhpur Group (JG) of Marwar Supergroup (MSG). Unique and rare volcanic features of MIS and its interface with the sandstone of JG have been declared as the National Geological Monuments of India. The site-specific landscape of the Soorsagar Formation (SSF) of JG covering about 54 sq. km area in the northern rural part of Jodhpur provides an outstanding record of seven types of geoheritage. Among these, the most significant sedimentary and paleontological geoheritage is represented by a treasure of sedimentary structures and a rich assemblage of Ediacaran fossils of marine paleo-ecosystem. Such records of past tectonics, climate, paleogeography, paleoecology, and environments showcasing 200 million years of Earth's history characterize the land-sea interaction and distribution in this part of Eastern Gondwana land. Thus, it displays global geodiversity of both intrinsic and extrinsic geoheritage values that provide eminent narratives for geo-education and geotourism. However, the unique geoheritage of the SSF landscape is under great threat to degradation and damage dominantly due to anthropological activities. To study such threats and damage, a study is conducted using various geological and remote sensing techniques. Interpretation of satellite images of about fifty years reveals that dominantly sandstone mining along with urbanization activities is responsible for damaging the significant geoheritage of SSF.

It covers a wide range of geological and geomorphic features of the western Himalaya including high mountain ranges, glacial valleys, saline to freshwater high-altitude lakes, and cold rocky desert. Himalaya is the product of a continent-continent collision between Indian and Eurasian plates and the closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean during the Late Mesozoic to Early Tertiary. The Neo-Tethys Ocean existed during the Mesozoic Era and completely disappeared along the north dipping subduction zones. The Ladakh Himalayan Ophiolites (LHO) are the remnants of the eastern part of the Neo-Tethys Ocean that were obducted discontinuously along the Indus Suture Zone and incorporated on the Indian continental margin. These include Dras-Thasgam-Suru Valley-Shergol dismembered ophiolitic slices and Nidar-Spongtang ophiolitic complexes. These ophiolitic remnants comprise typical lithostratigraphy, viz., radiolarian cherts, pillow volcanics, gabbros, mafic-ultramafic cumulates, and mantle peridotites. They are scattered in the Ladakh region, accessible by foot and road, and form recognizable picturesque outcrops.

The mountainous region is also marked by a number of historical forts, buildings, rock shelters, prehistoric cave paintings, captivating wildlife and rich mineral resources. Son Echo Point is a significant geotourism site located on the steep scarp of Markundi hill in the Sonbhadra district. It has been developed as the consequence of the Markundi-Jamwal Fault. From Son View Point, one can enjoy a panoramic and breathtaking/spectacular view of Son valley carved along the Son-Narmada lineament. The Markundi hills become a popular tourist destination during the monsoon season because of the stunning landscape and numerous seasonal waterfalls. Another major geotourism location is Veer Lorik Pathhar (stone), which is located on Markundi hill around 100 m from Son Echo Point. In addition to the geologists' point of view of its origin, it is also shrouded in captivating local folklore. The antiquity of human activity in this area goes back to the Lower Palaeolithic period. Numerous archaeological sites, such as cave monuments and cave paintings, have been uncovered, depicting the cultural and religious beliefs of the local population.

To develop geotourism activity in a certain region, assessing its geotourism potential is a prerequisite. The present study aims to develop a geotourism site suitability map for the Eastern Duars region, West Bengal, India, through the GIS-Based Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Approach (F-AHP) and Analytical Hierarchy Process. Based on the results of FAHP, a suitability map of geotourism has been prepared. It has been observed that about 6.30% of the study area is under highly suitable zones, 16.10% are suitable zones, 77.29% are marginally suitable zones, and 0.31% are not suitable zones. No proper recognition of the existing geosites and the lack of planned geotourism infrastructure is the reason for such a result. Finally, the result was validated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Area Under Curve (AUC). The values of the AUC value of ROC were 0.983 and 0.966 for F-AHP and AHP, respectively, which signify reliability for both methods. The findings suggest that the northern, north-eastern and north-western portions of the study area covering the areas of Kalchini, Madarihat-Birpara, and Kumargram are most suitable for geotourism. The selected criteria and the layers developed for the study can help the policy-makers to determine the ideal locations for the development of different infrastructures and plan accordingly so that the natural environment and tourism activities can co-exist and the essence of sustainable livelihood can be preserved in the Eastern Duars region. However, along with the planning, educating the locals and promoting the geosites about their significance is also very necessary for the recognition of the study area. Thus, the present study is novel in terms of geotourism site suitability with the GIS-based MCDM method in the Eastern Duars region of West Bengal, India.","[Islam, Nazrul; Paul, Indrayudh] Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma Univ, Dept Geog, Cooch Behar, West Bengal, India; [Sarkar, Bappa] Dinhata Coll, Dept Geog, Cooch Behar, West Bengal, India",,"Islam, N (corresponding author), Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma Univ, Dept Geog, Cooch Behar, West Bengal, India.",islamnazrul975@gmail.com; ayudhindra12@gmail.com; bappa.geo001@gmail.com,"Islam, Nazrul/ITV-5226-2023; SARKAR, BAPPA/JKI-7225-2023","Islam, Nazrul/0000-0002-0703-5463; SARKAR, BAPPA/0000-0002-0333-4159; Paul, Inayudh/0000-0001-8320-9376",,,,,82,3,3,3,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Fossil parks are among the primary geotourism attractions that support fossil preservation in-situ. Fossils are gems of paleontology, appearing as the remnants of species from past geological eras, and are prized sources of paleo-environmental history. These non-renewable Earth heritage serves as a conduit for scientific knowledge on historical climate, sedimentary environments, geographic circumstances, relative age determinations, and ecological practices. The extinction catastrophe known as the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event occurred about 251.5 million years ago and marks the transition between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic Periods. It was the most devastating known extinction event on Earth and the greatest of the Big Five mass extinctions of the Earth's history. The fossils and various geological features present at Permian-Triassic sections at Guryul and Mandakpal of Kashmir shed light on the Permian-Triassic (P-T) mass extinction event and preserve crucial knowledge about the effects of previous climate change on the Earth system. Besides, providing information on mass extinction, Guryul and Mandakpal of Kashmir provides a good opportunity for tourists to witness various geological features including fossils, minerals, rocks, caves, seismites, etc. Therefore it is very essential to protect such an area before it gets damaged by local intruders. A crucial step in this regard is the designation of the Permian-Triassic sections of Kashmir Himalaya as a worldwide geoheritage site. The promotion of geotourism is recognized as a global strategy for geoconservation. These prime geoheritage sites must be preserved and promoted for geotourism in order to boost the local economy, as they are significant from scientific, climatic, educational, and geological standpoint.","[Karim, Nozmul; Dar, Shamim A.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Wani, H.] Dept Higher Educ, Jammu, J&K, India; [Mir, Khalid Mahmood] Govt Degree Coll Boys, Dept Geol, Rajpora, J&K, India; [Ahmad, Rayees] Govt Model Higher Secondary Sch, Rajpora, J&K, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Dar, SA (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sjshamim@gmail.com,,"Dar, Shamim Ahmad/0000-0001-8046-1816","Department of Science & Technology, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India [M-14/0599, SRG/2022/001478]; Department of Science & Technology, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) [Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)], Government of India [6031]; Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Institutions of Eminence (IoE) Seed Grant","Department of Science & Technology, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Government of India; Department of Science & Technology, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) [Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)], Government of India; Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Institutions of Eminence (IoE) Seed Grant","We appreciate the Head, Department of Geology, Banaras Hindu University for providing the tools needed to complete the research.

The genesis of landscape settings primarily relies on regional geology, geomorphology, stream drainage networks, and lithology which also influences the hazard susceptibility. In the present study, the geomorphodiversity index (GMI) of Uttarakhand was evaluated using geodiversity (Geoi), drainage density diversity (Di), and morphometric diversity (Mi) indices, and classified into five classes (very low, low, moderate, high, very high). The significance of GMI was assessed with seismicity and land use land cover (LULC). The result shows that high to very high class GMI covers 21.03% and 8.52% area of Uttarakhand, mostly situated in the Higher Himalayan zone and Tethys Himalayan zone, characterized by high relative relief, deep valleys, and ridges. More than 75% of earthquake events in each GMI class were at a depth of 20 km or less, which reveals that different rates of seismicity occurred in moderate and very low classes of GMI. The spatial distribution of land use land cover (LULC) underscores the significance of GMI, particularly in areas with high susceptibility. The LULC distribution indicates that a very high class of GMI regions is associated with minimum tree cover, while bare land and rangeland majorly dominate the moderate to high class of GMI.","[Chauhan, Vipin; Gupta, Laxmi; Dixit, Jagabandhu] Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Greater Noida 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India",Shiv Nadar University,"Dixit, J (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Greater Noida 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India.",vc477@snu.edu.in; lg100@snu.edu.in; jagabandhu.dixit@snu.edu.in,"Dixit, Jagabandhu/AAC-5635-2022; Chauhan, Vipin/NUP-7553-2025; Gupta, Laxmi/IQS-2322-2023","Dixit, Jagabandhu/0000-0002-5450-578X; Chauhan, Vipin/0009-0008-3907-9314; Gupta, Laxmi/0000-0003-4453-3119",,,,,63,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,DEC,2024,16,4,,,,,,,134,10.1007/s12371-024-01041-w,0.0,,,16,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,M7S0X,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:001359485300001,0,india

The Chambal River basin harbours unique badlands renowned for their extensive geometry and development. These badlands result from fluvial activity in humid to sub-humid conditions, exhibiting considerable depth (similar to 80 m), steep slopes, and high drainage density. The Chambal badlands are distinguished by their riparian vegetation, including grasses, shrubs, and trees, as well as the presence of aquatic plants and dry deciduous forests comprising teak, sal, babul, and acacia. The ecological richness extends to its inhabitants, featuring the Gharial, Indian Skimmer, Ganges River Dolphin, Mugger Crocodile, and various avian species like eagles, vultures, kingfishers, and waterfowl. The exceptional topography and diverse and endangered flora and fauna distinguish the Chambal badlands as a unique site. Recognising its significance, preservation efforts are crucial to safeguard this area as a geoheritage site. This study delves into a comparative analysis of selected morphometric parameters between badlands and non-badland regions, aiming to comprehend the disparities in plain and rugged terrains. The investigation explores how human-induced or natural activities contribute to the transformation of badlands into flat areas, potentially compromising the integrity of the natural ecosystem.

Most landscape features possess unique values that need to be recognized nationally and internationally, conserved as Geoheritage sites as developed and promoted as Geotourism destinations. The present paper embodies and discusses aesthetic importance and geologic values of Columnar jointed basaltic dyke of Potla, also known as Kawadia Pahad-a geological treasure of Dewas District, Madhya Pradesh. The Potla dyke exposed in the form of seven detached linear ridges, trending ENE-WSW over a distance of 4.5 kms, having an average width of 80 m and exposed couple of meters (36 to 51 m) above the general ground level. The in situ columns in the dyke-ridges that so far been observed show straight, parallel faces without any striations. The length of the horizontal columns ranges between 1 and 3.60 m. The columns which are inclined and penetrated deep inside may have greater lengths. Such exposed columns have a height of 4.10 m which may be extending far downward. As far as diameter of the columns is concerned, it ranges between 30 and 50 cm. Each dyke-ridge consists perfectly separate, very well-developed, finely stacked and interlocked, horizontal to sub-horizontal columnar joints that inclined at various degrees. The columns are polygonal in the dyke-ridges, and majority show tetragon, pentagon, and hexagon shapes in cross section, but occasionally cyclic-hexagons can also be seen. The central part of the dyke, i.e. part of CR-5 and W-4 dyke-ridges, exhibits Dyke-Sill Hybrid Geometry. This monumental dyke-sill interface is not observed anywhere else except Columnar Trap Dyke of Potla, though this interpretation is based on orientation/interrelation of columns in the field. It is suggested that 66.6 +/- 0.5 Ma is the crystallization age of the columnar basaltic dyke of Potla. The dyke is rarest of rare, and therefore, numbers of amenities are recommended to fascinate the tourists so that this Geosite should be developed and promoted as a new Geotourism destination of India. The Potla dyke is picturesque and matchless in which the development of the columns is magnificent and the arrangement of the columns is amazing. This world-class dyke fulfils all the requirements of Geoheritage and Geotourism and should get the status of National Geological Monument (NGM).

Given an inclusive approach with local communities and the geoscientific communities as stakeholders, the UNESCO Global Geopark concept has gained popularity in India. Further, India provides a diverse range of geoheritage in terms of rock records from the Precambrian to the Holocene. The Kachchh region (western India) has tremendous scope to be conserved under the UNESCO Geopark programme as it sustains many plausible geosites. Of the numerous geosites within Kachchh, the Palasava locale holds geoheritage potential as it exposes similar to 14 million-year-old Chassra Formation sedimentary succession that is well-known to yield vertebrate (including marine and terrestrial mammals) fossils. These fossils hold significance in the context of origin and diversification of middle Miocene vertebrates (including mammals), Neogene biochronology of Kutch, palaeobiogeographic scenarios involving various vertebrate groups, and related aspects. In a geotourism context, the Palasava locale presents picturesque views being located between the Wagad Highland and the Little Rann of Kutch.

The present article showcases six important geological sites from the Narmada-Son Fault (NSF) zone, the Lower Narmada Valley, and the Lower Mahi Valley in central Mainland Gujarat from geoheritage and geotourism point of view. Three geosites are included from the NSF zone that comprise textbook examples of a fault controlled landscape and tectonically active fault zone. One of these geosites contains a layer of Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) ash layer midway in the exposed river cliff section that represents the largest volcanic eruption during Quaternary time, which occurred at similar to 74 ka in Indonesia. Two geosites from the Lower Narmada Valley are described that comprise one of the world's largest Late Pleistocene alluvial fan deposits and alluvial plain sediments with large-scale sedimentary bedforms indicating large size of the paleo-Narmada River compared to the present one. The geosite in Lower Mahi Valley comprises sediments representing the climatic changes during the last full glacial cycle, vertically stacked in one river section. All the described geosites are close to and accessible from the world's tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, which attracts millions of tourists. The geosites may be integrated with this tourist place and other sacred pilgrimage places along Narmada River to make geotourism sustainable.","[Maurya, Deepak M.; Vasaikar, Swarali; Chamyal, Laxman S.] Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Dept Geol, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India",Maharaja Sayajirao University Baroda,"Maurya, DM (corresponding author), Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Dept Geol, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India.",dmmaurya@yahoo.com,"Vasaikar, Swarali/AAD-3798-2022",,"We thank Prof. M.

The valley is filled with valley-fill deposits, including a hermit cave complex excavated by sages and local people of the valley. This hermit cave complex is extended between the different terrace levels, one or/and two-story structures carved in the quaternary sediments with a slight opening. Throughout history, the Lakhamandal valley has been located near a pilgrimage route famously known for its cultural and historical significance reflected in many historical texts of the Indian subcontinent. In the last few decades, the growing infrastructure in the valley has drawn local and international tourists leading to multiple unorganised excavations of the hermit caves in the region. To recognise such a remarkable geological and historical feature, we introduce the Lakhamandal valley hermit cave complex geosite with a preliminary assessment with SWOT analysis augmenting with urgent concerns and recommendations further aiming at its validation for a geoheritage site.","[Devrani, Rahul] OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Sonipat 131001, Haryana, India; [Devrani, Rahul] Univ Delhi, Inst Eminence, Delhi Sch Climate Change & Sustainabil, New Delhi 110007, India; [Kumar, Rohit] Indira Gandhi Natl Open Univ, Sch Sci, Discipline Geol, New Delhi 110068, India; [Dutt, Som] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, GMS Rd 33, Dehra Dun 248001, India; [Dutt, Som] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad, India; [Jamir, Rongsenzulu] Delhi Univ, Inst Eminence, Delhi Sch Publ Policy & Governance, New Delhi 110007, India",O.P.

These architectural marvels symbolise India's rich and diverse cultural heritage. They are cherished by people all over the world. Anthropogenic causes like environmental pollution have led to soiling and corrosion of natural stones used to construct these monuments. The diminishing beauty and accelerating deterioration of these monuments have become a matter of concern for all sections of society. In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyse the adequacy of the legal regime to protect the heritage stone monuments from environmental pollution. The introductory part of the paper provides a glimpse of various heritage stone monuments in India and their importance from the historical, cultural and architectural points of view. The next part elaborates on various causes of the degradation of these monuments. Case studies of the Taj Mahal and the Lotus Temple have been undertaken for comparative analysis, as both monuments have been constructed with heritage stones. Makrana Marble extracted from mines of Rajasthan has been used to build the Taj Mahal, whereas the Lotus Temple was constructed with marble extracted from ancient mines of Greece. The former was built during the Mughal era and the latter in the late twentieth century. The Taj Mahal is situated in Agra and the Lotus Temple in the national capital Delhi; for many centuries, both cities have been abuzz with social, economic and political activities. An attempt has been made to understand and analyse the impact of environmental pollution caused by human activities on these monuments. This study concludes that the inadequacy of the legal regime to protect these monuments from environmental pollutants has led to their degradation. In the end, suggestions have been made for protecting and conserving these monuments.","[Kaur, Pushpinder] Panjab Univ, Chandigarh 160014, India",Panjab University,"Kaur, P (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Chandigarh 160014, India.",pushpinderkaur535@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,3,4,1,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,SEP,2022,14,3,,,,,,,87,10.1007/s12371-022-00721-9,0.0,,,11,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,2T4ZX,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:000822485900001,0,india

In a first, survey research was conducted in Lucknow City (Uttar Pradesh State, north India) to anticipate the role of TIME and gain inferences on public awareness towards safeguarding the palaeontological wealth of the country. According to our survey research, the majority (61%) of respondents believe that creating a museum like TIME can significantly contribute to increasing public awareness and preserving India's geoheritage. Additionally, majority (65%) of the respondents said that they would like to experience a range of activities in the envisaged museum TIME, including but not limited to viewing science documentaries, attending lectures, and visiting fossil exhibits. Furthermore, similar to 37% of respondents reported their willingness to learn additional aspects linked to geological concepts and fossils. Thus, public engagement in the form of seminars, workshops, and other related activities must be regularly encouraged. Considering the small sample size (only 150 respondents), the present survey research can be expanded upon and modified in subsequent investigations. Nonetheless, the information gathered as part of the survey investigation may assist the scientific community and/or policymakers in decision-making as they actively advocate the development of TIME.","[Arora, Prachita; Trivedi, Prashant Mohan; Bhatia, Harshita; Agnihotri, Priya; Kapur, Vivesh V.] Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, India; [Arora, Prachita; Trivedi, Prashant Mohan; Bhatia, Harshita; Agnihotri, Priya; Kapur, Vivesh V.] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad 201002, Uttar Pradesh, India",Department of Science & Technology (India); Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR),"Kapur, VV (corresponding author), Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, India.;Kapur, VV (corresponding author), Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad 201002, Uttar Pradesh, India.",viveshkapur@gmail.com,"Kapur, Vivesh V/AAO-4885-2021","Kapur, Vivesh V/0000-0001-6542-5964; ARORA, PRACHITA/0000-0002-2810-312X; Bhatia, Harshita/0000-0002-1554-3177",The authors are grateful to the Director (Dr Vandana Prasad) of the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) for providing the necessary support and permission(s) (permission no.

Notwithstanding the stratabound nature of mineralisation, the distribution of Zn-Pb lodes is controlled by extensional shears and fold closures. Silver shows a distinct association with lead mineralisation. The presence of over 100 old working sites and several dumped metallurgical residues, spread over an area of over 50 sq km, bear testimony to the thriving mining and metallurgical operations in ancient to medieval times in Zawar and adjoining areas. The old workings were opened as deep linear trenches along with steeply inclined shafts that eventually opened into underground mining stopes supported by flared pillars. The ancient miners could perfect high-temperature zinc distillation processes in well-designed furnaces, and Zawar, therefore, holds the distinction of being the first centre, producing pure zinc on an industrial scale in the world. The most notable feature of Zawar Zn-Pb belt is the high preservation potential of excellently developed sedimentological and structural features that have received attention of researchers from different parts of the world. The Zawar is a seat of learning various facets of mineral exploration and has indeed turned out to be a unique set of geosites. The extensive network of old workings and well-preserved evidence of its being the earliest zinc metal-producing centre lends the status of geodiversity to the Zawar geosites. The ancient to medieval age cultural features emerging from the archaeological findings, and the historic significance of some of the old workings further add to the geodiversity of Zawar. This paper presents a detailed documentation of the scientific contents of Zawar geosites and associated geodiversities.","[Kumar, Arvind] Mohanlal Sukhadia Univ, Deparment Hist, Univ Rd, Udaipur 313001, Rajasthan, India; [Golani, P.

Several calc tufa sites occur along rapids and waterfalls in the upland plateau of the Deccan Traps in western India. Small deposits occur along the Harishchandragad ranges (Bhramanwada, Kotul), Kanhur plateau (Ane Ghat, Wadgaon Darya and Vambori) and the Sinhagad-Bhuleshwar Ranges (Katraj, Shindone, Ambale and Bhuleshwar) in the upland regions of western Deccan Traps. Calc tufa is porous and friable covered with dry organic debris, with encrusted stems, trunk and calcified roots representing phytoherm framestone facies. Well-developed clusters of stalactites are exposed on the roof of a cavern or along cascades. Mineralogically, the calc tufas are made of calcite and contain variable carbonate percentages (53 to 78%) with detrital basalt fragments, devitrified glass, plagioclase, quartz, agate, zeolites etc. The calc tufa from the study area shows delta O-18(V-SMOW) values ranging from 25.3 to 28.9 parts per thousand and delta C-13(V-PDB) values from - 3.6 to - 9.42 parts per thousand indicating significant regional variation in precipitation and source characteristics. The calc tufas were biological and physicochemically precipitated from waters at paleo temperatures of 16.3 to 27.1 degrees C (Kotul-Ane Ghat) and 29.5 to 34.6 degrees C (Bhuleshwar Ghat-Wadgaon Darya) in temperate to semi-arid climate. Despite their hydrogeological significance and importance as paleoclimatic indicators, the calc tufa occurrences from upland Deccan Traps have not received the attention they deserve.

Traditionally valued for paleo-glacial reconstructions, and validation of landform evolution models, alpine glacial landforms are increasingly recognized as prime destinations for educational tours and adventure tourism. The diverse glacial landforms, shaped through glacial advances and retreats during the Quaternary period, position the Kashmir Himalaya as a unique destination for geoheritage and geotourism hub, attracting visitors and researchers globally. Using Google Earth images and Digital Elevation Models, we systematically mapped and classified a range of glacial landforms, validating many through extensive field surveys. The study identifies a rich inventory of unique glacial geomorphosites, including moraine ridges, U-shaped valleys, horns, and cirques, which offer valuable insights into the region's geological history. These geomorphosites not only enhance scientific and educational understanding but also present significant opportunities for promoting sustainable geotourism and geoheritage conservation in the Kashmir Himalaya.

The formation and development of landforms are directly related to the geology, geomorphology, drainage basin characteristics, and soil types of the region. In the present study, a remote sensing and GIS-based geomorphodiversity index (GMI) assessment of Assam is performed using three sub-indices: geodiversity, morphometric diversity, and drainage diversity index. Sixty-six potential geomorphosites are identified with their geological, geomorphological, and GMI classes. With the help of a flood inundation map, the inundated area of each GMI class is calculated. According to the result, 27.02%, 10.76%, and 3.7% of the total area of Assam fall under moderate, high, and very high GMI classes, respectively. Barak Valley and Central Assam region exhibit high to very high GMI values. Geology and geomorphology have a strong influence on GMI values. About 22.32%, 28.33%, 37.18%, 38.25%, and 35.37% of areas with low, moderate, high, and very high GMI are inundated, respectively. This study determined that areas having high GMI can increase the geomorphological heritage value of the region and can play a significant role in promoting geotourism with an increase in the scientific, educational, and aesthetic value of geomorphosites. This study can also help the local governing authorities to conduct and implement better management and conservation policies for vulnerable locations.","[Gupta, Laxmi; Dixit, Jagabandhu] Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Delhi Ncr 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India",Shiv Nadar University,"Dixit, J (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Delhi Ncr 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India.",lg100@snu.edu.in; jagabandhu.dixit@snu.edu.in,"Gupta, Laxmi/IQS-2322-2023; Dixit, Jagabandhu/AAC-5635-2022","Gupta, Laxmi/0000-0003-4453-3119; Dixit, Jagabandhu/0000-0002-5450-578X",,,,,98,1,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

The Moidams were built on piedmont to alluvial zone of the colluvial deposits of the Naga Thrust, located in the North-East part of Assam in India. The transit of Ahom rulers from Yunnan (China borderlands to Charaideo, Assam, India), where the Ahoms established their first capital, via Burma (Myanmar) and Nagaland showcases a unique historical account of the region. The lifestyle, practices and the quest for newer land of the Ahoms, which would justify their long-term occupational goals, also highlighted their understanding of climate, tectonics and man-environment relationships. The architecture of Moidams and their sitting at the piedmont at Charaideo is unique in terms of their long-standing history of 600 years in the face of natural wrath of disasters like earthquakes and seasonal floods. Based upon detailed investigation and assessment carried out by several researchers for geoheritage sites and geoarcheosites, the Moidams at Charaideo, best exemplifies.

This paper focuses on evaluating a promising geological heritage site in Rajasthan, the Palaeo-Mesoproterozoic Stromatolite Park at Bhojunda (District Chittorgarh). The Bhagwanpura Limestone Formation of the Lower Vindhyan Group hosts well-preserved stromatolites at this geosite. The paper assesses, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the potential of this stromatolite-bearing site and based on the available data and analysis considers it to be a strong candidate for a potential geoheritage site. SWOT analysis also suggests that the site has immense potential but at the same time, is in urgent need of geoconservation. Stromatolites provide valuable insights into the early life on Earth; the Stromatolite Park at Bhojunda holds a significant potential as a Geoheritage site due to its extensive geological exposure. Stromatolites are layered sedimentary structures formed mainly by photosynthetic microorganisms that include cyanobacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and Pseudomonadota. They produce cementing materials that bind sediments (sand and other rocky materials) to form microbial mats. In the present study, species from seven genera, namely Conophyton cylindricus, Baicalia baicalica, Collenia columnaris, and Kussiella kussiensis, Tungussia sp., Stratifera rara, and Weedia walcott are recorded suggesting a lower-middle Riphean age. Petrographically, the Bhagwanpura Limestone is composed of fine grains of calcite and dolomite with dispersed grains of cryptocrystalline silica, iron oxide, chert fragments, and veinlets of quartz and calcite. Present analysis suggests that the Bhojunda Stromatolite Park meets all standards to become a Global Geopark. It is crucial to take the necessary actions to apply for UNESCO confirmation, advocating not just community-driven conservation of the region's geological heritage but also fostering sustainable development by improving the native tribes' standard of living.","[Quasim, M.

A peri-cratonic Kachchh rift basin in western India exposes varied geological formations and structures, from the Jurassic to Recent. Kachchh basin is characterized by rocky uplifts and pediments with deciduous and scanty forest, which suggest a semi-arid climate while hypersaline Rann and Banni plains show an arid to hyper-arid climate. The deteriorating grasslands of Banni were known as Savanna-type grasslands of Asia. Several natural and anthropogenic factors have led to its depletion. Owing to its unique geological, aesthetic, botanical and cultural values, the Banni Grasslands hold a potential candidature for a critical geo-observatory site status, both at national and international levels. The geological evolutionary history of this fragile eco-zone with a strong anthropological background calls for a holistic sustainable development that encompasses the socio-economical needs and ecological agility at the same time. The plains of Banni are unique geomorphic features with distinct ecology, traditional climate-human sustainable practice model and diverse folk arts and skills of making climate-tectonic resistive dwellings. The grasslands to the north merge into the marshes and uplifted mudflats as the Rann terrain. The present paper is an attempt to understand the socio-economic intricacies of Banni grassland in light of its unique geological origin and ecological vulnerabilities. It focuses on traditional and sustainable ecological knowledge of the local folks with distinct harmony of their art and architecture so interwoven with the activeness of the climate and tectonics of Banni.

The petrological details derived from the host rock samples shows microstructures like micro-folding, foliations, quartz grain elongation etc., thus representing the microscale deformations within the rock units occurring in the area.The lab-based spectral signatures of manganese-bearing host rock was resampled to image spectra and spectral anomaly map using Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), which shows good correlation with the existing mine locations.The information from remote sensing and lab analysis has been integrated thematically using the knowledge-based Weighted Sum Method (WSM) with existing mine locations as the training dataset. The derived mineral prospect map indicates several new areas of manganese prospectivity which can serve as a guide for detailed future explorations in the region .& COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

We report oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) of spring water before, within, and after the tectonically active zones of the Alaknanda Valley, Uttarakhand. Higher variation of delta O-18 in the spring waters is found in highly tectonically disturbed zone i.e., Zone-2 with delta O-18 range - 4.9 parts per thousand to - 9.0 parts per thousand compared to tectonically less disturbed zones: Zone-1 and Zone-3 with delta O-18 value range - 7.9 parts per thousand to - 9.9 parts per thousand and - 7.4 to - 10.2 parts per thousand respectively. We hypothesize that the highly active thrust zones (Zone-2) with increased permeability compared to other Zones, manifested as greater spring density, results in higher water recharge in Zone-2. Very high to high spring density stretches are dominant in Zone-2 compared to Zone-1 and Zone-3. Stretches in Zone-2 with high spring density formed due to its highly tectonically active nature leads to the higher isotopic variation in Zone-2.

The diversity in geological traits reveals that the Phalal watershed was characterized by contact zone of two lithological formations (Augun gneiss 95% and Rautgara quartzites 5%) separated by north Almora thrust (NAT) while the entire Siya watershed was developed only in one formation, i. e. Rautgara ( quartzites) Formation. The diversity in geomorphometric personality and geomorphic evolution speaks of a differential development of both watersheds in context of stage of erosion. The zone of critical-height above which the erosion is acute is 1700 to 1800 m in Phalal watershed, whereas 1500 to 1600 m in Siya watershed; the hypsometric integral determines Phalal watershed (49.96 %) under middle-mature stage while Siya watershed (57.07 %) achieved early-mature stage. Diversity in erosion status was observed along the varying altitudes of the watersheds under different land use/cover. Diversity in the spatial distribution of altitude, erosion intensity, average slope versus land use/cover status under both watersheds determines the impact of basin-area extremity. The hazardous geomorphic processes also indicate the impact of basin- area extremity as eleven types of geomorphic hazards were experienced by the Phalal watershed while only four types of hazards were experienced by Siya watershed. Phalal watershed was 18.42 % hazardous area while 21.04 % hazardous area was possessed by Siya watershed. The hazard of `surficial erosion' covers maximum area, i. e. 13.78 % in Phalal watershed while 20.52 % area is possessed by Siya watershed. Likewise maximum study units attained degree 4 instability for Phalal watershed (80%) while degree 2 instability for Siya (50%) watershed. Thus, basin-area has direct posture on geological traits, geomorphic evolution, geomorphometric personality and hazardous geomorphic processes while land use/cover status has no bearing on basinarea extremity under the studied watersheds.","[Pande, Anita] Kumaun Univ, Dept Geog, Naini Tal 263001, India",Kumaun University,"Pande, A (corresponding author), Kumaun Univ, Dept Geog, Naini Tal 263001, India.",anni_pan@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,24,1,1,1,7,GEOLOGICAL SOC INDIA,BANGALORE,"NO 63, 12TH CORSS, BASAPPA LAY OUT, GAVIPURAM PO, PO BOX 1922, BANGALORE, 560-019, INDIA",0016-7622,0974-6889,,J GEOL SOC INDIA,J.

However, the existence of this cliff, belonging to the Warkalli Formation of Mio-Pliocene age, has been threatened in recent decades by both natural and anthropogenic factors. This is mainly attributed to climate change, sea level rise, and the adversities of rapid economic developments. The present study aims to identify critical areas by investigating the causative factors, such as geological, marine, and anthropogenic factors, that have led to the degradation of this geomorphological marvel. Based on the comprehensive study, such as cross-profile analysis, groundwater table mapping, shoreline change analysis using DSAS, sediment transport characterization, and wave modeling, it is revealed that wave-induced toe erosion, groundwater seepage through the friable sandstones of the formation, other physical, chemical, and biological interactions as well as human interferences are the main drivers behind the degradation. The vulnerable locations are under high development pressure, which needs to be regulated at any cost. A set of multi-faceted recommendations combining 'grey', 'green', and 'hybrid' measures is proposed herein to protect and preserve the Varkala cliff and its frontal beaches. Strict adherence to the implementation of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plan to control developmental activities, continuous monitoring of the cliff coast for taking timely remedial measures, application of appropriate shore protection techniques, hybrid measures for the protection of the cliff face, etc., is suggested for immediate consideration.","[Nair, L.

Terrestrial analogues Earth locations with geological features resembling Martian terrains are critical for bridging Earth-based research with planetary exploration. The Kachchh basin in northwestern India, particularly the Matanomadh Formation, is a noteworthy analogue site. This late Paleocene formation exhibits sedimentary structures like cross-stratified sandstone, clay pockets, and weathered lateritic profiles, resembling Martian landscapes such as Mawrth Vallis and Meridiani Planum. Key minerals, including jarosite and hydrous sulfates, identified through XRD and other geochemical techniques such as SEM-EDS, further enhance its relevance due to their association with ancient aqueous activity on Mars. Fieldwork and remote sensing reveal depositional features indicative of dynamic fluvial processes, akin to ancient Martian riverbeds. Jarosite's presence suggests acidic, oxidizing conditions, mirroring Mars' Noachian to Hesperian transition. The study also highlights connections to Earth's Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, offering insights into both planetary and terrestrial climate history. Recognizing the Matanomadh Formation as a Geoheritage site would ensure its preservation, promote scientific research, and foster sustainable geotourism.

The crescendo of this story is the formation and later break-up of the supercontinent Gondwana, followed by the Indian subcontinent's solitary northward drift as an island landmass. This remarkable journey through diverse climates profoundly shaped its history as a unique travelling nursery of plant and animal life, a story etched in the fossils discovered across the subcontinent. India's Phanerozoic rocks hold globally significant palaeontological treasures, from dinosaur nesting sites and the earliest odd-toed mammals to ancient walking whales and some of the planet's oldest plant groups. Furthermore, the older Precambrian shield regions offer a glimpse into life before complex organisms evolved and are also vital repositories of mineral wealth. Astonishingly and sadly, despite this rich palaeontological and geological heritage, India lacks a central Natural History Museum to safeguard and showcase these treasures for public education and appreciation. To address this critical gap, the establishment of The Indian Museum of Earth (TIME) has been initiated through collaborative efforts supported by the office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India.

This paper focuses on 10 geosites located in the Udaipur, Rajsamand, and Desuri regions, situated in the south-central part of Rajasthan. These geosites form part of the Aravalli and Delhi Fold Belts of the Aravalli Mountains, showcasing a diverse array of geological features, including Precambrian orogenic processes, collision tectonics, ophiolite suites, shallow shelf carbonate facies, and ancient global oxidation events, all remarkably preserved within this terrain. The proposed belt contains classic exposures of igneous and metamorphic rock assemblages, complex deformation patterns, and structural features that are prominently displayed along road cuts and nearby landscapes. These sites also hold cultural significance, with several ancient and revered temples, enhancing their value for geotourism. The belt has served as a natural laboratory for generations of geologists, providing fundamental field knowledge and inspiring numerous scientific studies. The proper conservation and scientific interpretation of these geosites will promote geotourism, support geological research, and foster public appreciation of Earth's geological heritage. Developing these sites with appropriate educational materials will also enhance field-based learning for students, researchers, and the general public. Conservation of these sites will benefit the national and international geological community, facilitating further research into the geological evolution of the Aravalli-Delhi Fold Belt. Therefore, the authors propose the systematic conservation of this belt for future geologists, researchers, students, and curious tourists, ensuring its preservation for generations to come.","[Kapasya, Harish; Rathore, Monika Kanwar; Chauhan, Narendra Kumar] Mohanlal Sukhadia Univ, Dept Geol, Udaipur 313001, India; [Chauhan, Gaurav D.] Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Verma Kachchh Univ, Dept Geosci, Bhuj 370001, India",Mohanlal Sukhadia University,"Chauhan, GD (corresponding author), Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Verma Kachchh Univ, Dept Geosci, Bhuj 370001, India.",gdc.dew@gmail.com,,,,,,,78,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1867-2477,1867-2485,,GEOHERITAGE,Geoheritage,JUN 13,2025,17,3,,,,,,,95,10.1007/s12371-025-01134-0,0.0,,,19,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology,3SL3V,,,,,2026-02-01,WOS:001507917700001,0,india

Here civilization has existed at least seventh century. Shifting of capital by the King of Chamba from Bharmour to Chamba around the 10th Century, remains an unsolved puzzle. This poses a question that what were the factors that forced the King to shift his capital from Bharmour to Chamba? Did an earthquake force him, or was it related to other catastrophic events related to climate? We have studied the archaeological monuments of Bharmour, Chamba and Kangra regions for seismological study and core sediments of Khajjiar Lake for palaeoclimatic reconstruction for last 4400 years. The obtained results were corroborated with the published palaeo-seismological data of the region. The palaeo-climatic data of the past 1500 years indicate that there were stable climatic conditions in the region. The published palaeo-seismological study, over the surface rupture of 1905 earthquake, documented three historical earthquakes between (i) 2500-900 BC (ii) 890 BC-720 AD (iii) 750-1290AD. The third historical earthquake (750-1290 AD) corresponds to the shifting time of capital from Bharmour to Chamba (i.e tenth century). This suggests that a major earthquake may have been responsible for shifting of capital from Bharmour to Chamba. In addition to the rich cultural heritage, these monuments have a great potential to serve as geoheritage sites. These deformed monumental features can be used in educational exhibits, guided tours, and interpretive trails to educate people about the earthquake history of the region. It can also be used to stress the importance of being ready for disasters and building resilience in both locals and visitors.","[Joshi, M.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Sikkim Reg Ctr, Gangtok, India; [Joshi, M.; Thakur, V.

The sites were selected after several detailed field seasons based on numerous factors such as individuality, scenic views, tourist attraction, peculiarity, uniqueness, and potential for tourism education as well as scientific studies. Additionally, they have been assessed with a quantitative scheme to determine their suitability for becoming geosites. The present study has narrowed down thirteen sites, which have a wide range of geological aspects. This variation in the range can promote the area to become a field geological museum and an arena to hone one's field aptitude with a rich repository of literature published over the century. Such initiatives can also foster learning for sustainability by deepening our understanding of natural systems and encouraging responsible stewardship. Geosites are often overlooked and lost to the pages of obscurity buried within the pages of scientific literature; promoting them by granting the status of a Geoheritage site garners the attention of the masses as well as their appreciation for such features. Consequently, it becomes our duty to preserve such marvels as natural wealth for future generations through frameworks rooted in sustainable tourism and education for peace, ensuring that development is inclusive, mindful, and resilient.","[Joshi, Aditya U.; Baruah, Kaushik; Godinho, Joshua; Khaliz, Muhammed; Samji, Sakshi V.] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India; [Akolkar, Gayatri; Gorania, Parita; Limaye, Manoj A.; Deota, Bhushan S.] Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Fac Sci, Deparment Geol, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India; [Solanki, Tirthrajsinh; Solanki, Pushprajsinh] Prime Geo Serv Pvt Ltd, 1553 Chitrakut Housing Soc,Akashwani,Makarpura Rd, Vadodara 390009, Gujarat, India; [Chauhan, Gaurav] KSKV Kachchh Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Kachchh 370001, Gujarat, India",Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE); Maharaja Sayajirao University Baroda,"Akolkar, G (corresponding author), Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Fac Sci, Deparment Geol, Vadodara 390002, Gujarat, India.",akolkargayatri@gmail.com,,"Godinho, Joshua/0009-0000-5959-9044","Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal [576104]; Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Vadodara; K.

The islands feature six distinct geotectonic units, including the Andaman Trench/Inner Slope, Outer High/Trench Slope Break, Fore Arc Basin, Volcanic Arc, Back Arc Basin, and Mergui Terrace. These regions comprise ophiolite, flysch deposits, and deep-marine sediments, which are easily accessible and offer valuable insights into deep-marine processes. The stratigraphic sequence of the islands encompasses metasedimentaries, an ophiolite complex, the Baratang Group, and the Archipelago Group. The Archipelago Group comprises seven formations, providing well-preserved deep-marine facies for detailed biostratigraphic analysis. These locations are for studying deep marine processes and sedimentation. The Port Blair Turbidites, characterized by excellent exposures, serve as classical examples for studying turbidite deposits. Petrological and sedimentological analyses have been conducted on these turbidites, providing valuable insights into their facies and characteristics. Additionally, the islands offer well-preserved chalk facies with diverse microfossils, presenting an excellent opportunity to study pelagic and hemipelagic sedimentation processes. Thus, it has become essential to preserve and protect Cretaceous sedimentary sequences for teaching and training purposes. We have identified nine major important geoheritage locations that should be preserved for the future. These sites are (1) Mauricedra Beach geosite (b) Panchwati geosites (c) Port Blair geosite (d) Baratang limestone (e) Mud volcanoes (f) Kalapathar geosite (g) Lacam Point (h) Natural rock arc (i) Bharatpur beach.

The geological archives of the western part of the Kutch Basin are bestowed with spectacular igneous structures formed during the Deccan Trap volcanism. Overlying, Cenozoic successions of the Kutch Basin also get affected by the global climatic perturbations, which get registered in their impressive stratigraphic successions. Sedimentation in the basin was primarily controlled by the rate of relative sea-level fluctuations vs. background siliciclastic supply. Combined effect of climatic perturbations and relative sea-level fluctuation along passive-margin setting resulted in the occurence of variety of fossils, lithology and sedimentary structures, available all over the Cenozoic outcrops. To conserve and protect endangered geological features, geoscientists around the world have recognized several geosites, which can serve as standard reference section for further research and sustainable development for generations. In this study, we identify some spectacular outcrops from the western parts of the Kutch Basin (Cenozoic outcrops and Deccan Trap exposures) and document their properties to be recognized as potential geosites. These sites preserve exclusive geological features and provide template to understand the geological processes, however, needs conservation and protection. We propose the following assorted geosites viz. (1) Entablature geosite, (2) Pillow lava geosite, (3) Taphonomy geosite, (4) Fossil crab geosite, (5) Trace fossil geosite and (6) Soft sediment deformation (SSD) geosite. These sites may serve as exclusive locations for students field excursion, field-training for diverse professionals, social outreach activities and future reference section; indeed helps to achieve the implementation of some of the geoheritage goals.

As tourist sites emerge at different evolutionary stages of tourism development, they may face various potential threats. This study examines the stages of tourism development and assesses the associated degradation risks using the Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) and Degradation Risk Assessment (DRA) frameworks on 14 geomorphosites in the Ajodhya hill area of the eastern Chota Nagpur plateau, famous for its diverse geological and geomorphological features and growing tourist attraction. Subsequently, the intricate relationship between the stages of tourism development and potential threats to geomorphosites are also addressed in this work. For the TALC analysis, 10 criteria and several indicators are considered to determine the current tourism development stage and DRA analysis using 20 parameters consisting of 4 indicators has been assessed. The findings reveals that, the most of the geomorphosites lies in the exploration stage except two geomorphosites (namely, Chunkadi spring and Jugni cave) with moderate to high risk of degradation. The extent of degradation in the region is largely influenced by mismanagement of sites, meteorological vulnerabilities and increasing public usage. Thus by addressing the most vulnerable risk factors, effective management strategies and conservation measures would assist towards sustainable geotourism development locally and also could be utilized for preservation of similar sites.","[Mandal, Uttam Kumar; Karmakar, Manas; Mondal, Sajal; Tamang, Lakpa; Ghosh, Debasis] Univ Calcutta, Dept Geog, Kolkata, India",University of Calcutta,"Tamang, L (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Geog, Kolkata, India.",ltgeog@caluniv.ac.in,"Tamang, Lakpa/N-6289-2019","Tamang, Lakpa/0000-0001-9233-2528","UGC; UGC, India","UGC(University Grants Commission, India); UGC, India(University Grants Commission, India)","The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of UGC, India to the first author.

These basalt units are not suitable either for excavation or sculpturing, because of inherent cooling cracks. Weathering of iron minerals also reduces their utilization for work of art. From the beginning of first century, ancient artisans have identified thermally baked zones in the vicinity of lava tubes, channels and effusive centres. Newly formed rocks within these zones are indurated, hardened and excellent for excavation, sculpturing and polishing. The degree of induration is also skilfully utilized, black basalt has acquired vibrant shades of red by amalgamating iron minerals. Depending on religious believes, Hindus excavated enormous Kailash temple from the top of the hill with intricate sculpturing of idols and statues, while Buddhists excavated large meditation halls (Vihars) with columns and arches. We identified hidden effusive centre in the vicinity of Ellora cave complex. Physical volcanic feature such as portal portion of lava tube is utilized for locating large Saptashrungi temple. Silica rich agglomerate basalt, with large fragments is used for coarse carving of tall Buddha statue, corresponding with the sixth-century Bamiyan caves in Afghanistan, while exceedingly fine-grained agglomerate is preferred for intricate carving of Shiva idol in Elephanta caves. Damage by invaders and erosion are usually repaired by cement and concrete, losing aesthetic sense.
