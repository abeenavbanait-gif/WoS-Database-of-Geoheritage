Inventory and Quantitative Assessment of Geosites and Geodiversity Sites: a Review,"Brilha, J",824,"The inventory and quantitative assessment of the most valuable occurrences of geodiversity are essential steps in any geoconservation strategy and in the establishment of priorities in site management. Despite the existence of many site inventories applied to different scales (countries, municipalities, parks, etc.), the criteria used for their selection are often unclear and poorly defined. This paper proposes a new approach to the concepts of geosite and geodiversity site and reviews the procedures used in the development of a systematic site inventory applied to different scales and values. Procedures to achieve a numerical evaluation of the value and degradation risk of sites are reviewed and new criteria are proposed. Finally, guidelines are presented, bearing in mind the preparation of effective geodiversity inventories, to support geoparks' strategies. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding and use of the above-mentioned concepts, which are essential for the implementation of geoconservation actions worldwide.",2016,GEOHERITAGE,portugal,

Geotourism's Global Growth,"Dowling, RK",388,"Geotourism is essentially 'geological tourism'. The geological element focuses on geology and landscape and includes both 'form', such as landforms, rock outcrops, rock types, sediments, soils and crystals, and 'process', such as volcanism, erosion, glaciation etc. The tourism element of geotourism includes tourists visiting, learning from, appreciating and engaging in geosites. Geotourism is an integral part of UNESCO's geoparks and is essential to their development. Geotourism adds to ecotourism's principal focus on plants (flora) and animals (fauna) by adding a third dimension of the abiotic environment. Thus it is growing around the world through the growth of geoparks as well as independently in many natural and urban areas where tourism's focus in on the geological environment.",2011,GEOHERITAGE,australia,Edith Cowan University
Global Centers of vascular plant diversity,"Barthlott, W; Mutke, J; Rafiqpoor, D; Kier, G; Kreft, H",276,"The diversity of vascular plants is very Unevenly distributed across the globe. The five centres that reach species richness of more than 5,000 spp./10,000 km(2) (Costa Rica-Choco, Atlantic Brazil. Tropical Eastern Andes, Northern Borneo, New Guinea) cover only 0.2% of the terrestrial surface. On the other hand approximately 18,500 spp. are endemic to these centres which represent 6.2% of all vascular plant species. A world map of vascular plant richness is presented based on an extensively expanded data base (more than 3,300 species richness figures lot different regions of the world) and a refined methodology. Most of the global centres are located in mountainous regions within the humid tropic,. where suitable climatic conditions and high levels of geodiversity, i.e., the diversity of abiotic conditions. coincide.

Geotourism and Geoparks as Novel Strategies for Socio-economic Development in Rural Areas,"Farsani, NT; Coelho, C; Costa, C",269,"Geoparks, as an innovation for the protection of natural and geological heritages, play an important role in the development of geotourism. While developing geotourism, the establishment of geoparks can generate new job opportunities, new economic activities and additional sources of income, especially in rural regions. It encourages the production of local products and local handicrafts involved in geotourism and geoproducts. This paper discusses the role played by geoparks in improving the economy of local populations. To this end, 25 geopark strategies were analysed (20 in Europe and 3 in Asia [Malaysia, Japan and Iran], 1 in Australia and 1 in South America [Brazil]).

Geoconservation as an Emerging Geoscience,"Henriques, MH; dos Reis, RP; Brilha, J; Mota, T",262,"The main purpose of geoconservation is the conservation of geosites as basic units of the geological heritage through the implementation of specific inventory, evaluation, conservation, valuation and monitoring procedures. In this paper, geoconservation is characterised as an emergent geoscience within the Earth and Space Sciences where its scope and methods, as well as production and validation of knowledge can be recognised-thus defining Basic Geoconservation-, interrelations with other earth sciences can be established-thus supporting Applied Geoconservation-, and Technical Applications of Geoconservation can be identified through the production of materials, methods and/or scientific services useful to society, namely geoeducation. Promoting scientific education relevant to sustainable development requires new educational approaches involving the Earth Sciences, namely through geoconservation, in order to provide citizens with tools to face environmental problems, such as those arising from the depletion of geological resources-which seriously threaten the geological heritage of the Earth-and the information, skills and will make forward-looking choices, like supporting the legal protection of Natural Monuments and/or the implementation of geotourism (including geoparks).",2011,GEOHERITAGE,portugal,Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Minho; Universidade de Lisboa
Geodiversity: An integrative review as a contribution to the sustainable management of the whole of nature,"Brilha, J; Gray, M; Pereira, DI; Pereira, P",257,"In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aiming to achieve a better world for the entire human population. In spite of the fact that human development is dependent on nature and its resources, the non-living (abiotic) natural resources and processes are persistently neglected in international and national policies that foster sustainable development.

A spatially explicit deep learning neural network model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility,"Dao, DV; Jaafari, A; Bayat, M; Mafi-Gholami, D; Qi, CC; Moayedi, H; Phong, TV; Ly, HB; Le, TT; Trinh, PT; Luu, C; Quoc, NK; Thanh, BN; Pham, BT",248,"With the increasing threat of recurring landslides, susceptibility maps are expected to play a bigger role in promoting our understanding of future landslides and their magnitude. This study describes the development and validation of a spatially explicit deep learning (DL) neural network model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility. A geospatial database was generated based on 217 landslide events from the Muong Lay district (Vietnam), for which a suite of nine landslide conditioning factors was derived. The Relief-F feature selection method was employed to quantify the utility of the conditioning factors for developing the landslide predictive model. Several performance metrics demonstrated that the DL model performed well both in terms of the goodness-of-fit with the training dataset (AUC = 0.90; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.36) and the ability to predict future landslides (AUC = 0.89; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.38). The efficiency of the model was compared to the quadratic discriminant analysis, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and multi-layer perceptron neural network. A comparative analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant improvement of landslide prediction using the spatially explicit DL model over these other models. The insights provided from this study will be valuable for further development of landslide predictive models and spatially explicit assessment of landslide-prone regions around the world.",2020,CATENA,vietnam,Shahrekord University; Central South University; Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST); Duy Tan University; National University of Civil Engineering; Nguyen Tat Thanh University (NTTU); Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST)
3G's for Modern Geotourism,"Hose, TA",247,"Since the initial recognition and definition in the early 1990s of geotourism in the UK by a few academic geologists, and its emergence in Europe as a niche form of sustainable tourism, new stakeholders have become involved; the latter's background is often commercial and lacking in any significant academic or scientific engagement. Consequently, the geosite/geomorphosite management and promotional approaches they adopt are usually founded on practitioner and supply side led approaches rather than the geoconservation requirements of geosites/geomorphosites and the needs and expectations of their geotourists. This is probably because the new stakeholders have limited knowledge and understanding of the relevance of the history, development and philosophy of landscape conservation and promotion (that is geohistory), and the lessons that can be gleaned from such considerations in managing and promoting geosites. This paper seeks to redress this situation by providing an outline of the historical and theoretical underpinnings of geotourism and approaches to its sustainable management. It especially examines and defines, underpinned by UK examples, three key interrelated aspects (the '3G's') of modern geotourism: geoconservation, geohistory and geo-interpretation. It further updates a prior published geohistorical model and provides a new summary topology and a geotourism chronosequence. Finally, it addresses, within the framework of the new definition and its approach, some of the issues generated by the development of geoparks in Europe in the first decade of the twenty-first century.",2012,GEOHERITAGE,england,University of Bristol
Quantification of geodiversity and its loss,"Ruban, DA",230,"Geodiversity, i.e., a diversity of geological heritage sites, can be quantified with an account of geosite types, type counterparts, and their ranks. Higher numbers of geosite types represented within a given territory and their higher ranks indicate a higher geodiversity. Two additional characteristics, namely geoabundance and georichness, allow measure of the quantity of geosites and the diversity-quantity relationship respectively. Geodiversity loss can be evaluated with an accounting of decreases in geosite type ranks linked to the damage of geosites. A calculation of relative and multi-dimensional geodiversity helps in quantitative assessment of the regional geological heritage. (C) 2010 The Geologists' Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Damage control: Restoring the physical integrity of America's rivers,"Graf, WL",221,"Technological development of America's rivers, including the installation of mure than 80,000 dams, has segmented the streams and fragmented their watersheds. A vision for the nation's rivers requires science and public policy that emphasize restoration and maintenance of the rivers' physical integrity to create a great river legacy for future generations. The Clean Water Act mandates the biological, chemical, and physical integrity of the nation's rivers, but researchers and decision makers have paid scant attention to physical integrity. Physical integrity fur rivers refers to a set of active fluvial processes and landforms wherein the channel, near channel landforms, sediments, and overall river configuration maintain a dynamic equilibrium, with adjustments not exceeding limits of change defined by societal values. Rivers with physical integrity have functional surfaces and materials that are susceptible to monitoring and measurement with a set of geographic indicator parameters. Science and policy for the nation's rivers must blend watershed principles with ecosystem concepts, focus on change rather than equilibrium as a defining characteristic of streams, adopt probabilistic rather than exclusively deterministic approaches, and pursue geographic representativeness through hydrodiversity, geodiversity, and biodiversity. The dams that fragment the system also offer opportunities for restoration of some natural characteristics through adjusted operating rules, redesign, and physical renovation, along with the removal of some dysfunctional structures. In the near future, when social values for rivers are likely to revolve around protection for endangered species, economics of flood protection, and clam removal issues, we can enhance restoration efforts by including physical integrity in research agendas, policy decisions, operational rulemaking, and public debate. Our multicentury legacy for future generations can and should be to establish physical integrity fur rivers that are as natural as possible, thus insuring that as a system they are parts of the infrastructure for a vibrant national economy, continuing threads of our cultural heritage, and quality natural environments.",2001,ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS,usa,Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe
Integrated Approach for the Inventory and Management of Geomorphological Heritage at the Regional Scale,"Reynard, E; Perret, A; Bussard, J; Grangier, L; Martin, S",219,"Due to the renewed interest for sites of geological interest, both in nature conservation and tourist sectors, numerous regional and national geosite inventories have been carried out in several countries during the last two decades. Several research groups discussed methodological issues, in particular concerning the assessment, and proposed various assessment methods. The University of Lausanne developed a method for assessing the scientific and additional values of geomorphosites in 2007. The method was widely used in regional inventories in Switzerland and abroad. This paper presents a new version of the method and discusses four main issues: (1) the assessment methodology is included in a larger process, from the selection of potential geomorphosites to their use and evaluation by stakeholders; (2) a particular attention is put on the selection of potential geomorphosites that will then be assessed and a simple approach crossing a spatial selection (the selected geomorphosites should be representative of the regional geomorphological processes) and a temporal one (the selected geomorphosites should cover the whole temporal stages of the regional morphogenesis, with both relict and active landforms) is proposed; (3) a new part is added in the assessment method; it concerns the use characteristics and fills a gap in the existing method; (4) finally, the paper discusses mapping and representation issues: specific maps are produced at two levels: simple geomorphological maps accompany the assessment of each geomorphosite and synthetic maps, covering the whole study area, are produced for the communication of results to stakeholders. For this, four types of representation (qualitative, univariate, bivariate, multivariate) are proposed. The method is illustrated by three examples of inventories carried out in Western Switzerland and Haute-Savoie (France).",2016,GEOHERITAGE,switzerland,University of Lausanne

The methodology is based on several existing models and presented through two groups of values - main and additional, which are further divided into indicators and subindicators respectively. The resultant model is a graph that consists of nine fields, into which geosites can be classified as fitting into nine general areas of suitability for tourism in terms of their main (scientific/educational, aesthetic/scenic and protection as market appeal and conservation) and additional values (functional and tourism use as current stage of development).

Geodiversity: developing the paradigm,"Gray, M",212,"GRAY, M. 2008. Geodiversity: developing the paradigm. Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, 119, 287-298. The term 'geodiversity' was first used in 1993 as the geological equivalent of biodiversity. It has gained in international acceptance and usage in recent years and now warrants the status of it geological paradigm. This article develops some new theoretical and practical aspects of geodiversity, including a discussion of the origin and evolution of the geodiversity of Planet Earth and whether there are geodiversity hotspots. Although the word 'geodiversity' is a relatively recent introduction, the concept has been used as the basis for selecting geoconservation sites in many countries and is being used increasingly to guide the nomination and assessment process for geological World Heritage Sites. The paper then discusses the aims and methods of geoconservation and how these vary depending on which element of geodiversity is being considered. Finally, the relevance of geodiversity to geotourism, leisure activities and geoparks is explored.",2008,PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION,england,University of London
Quantitative Assessment of Geotopes as an Effective Tool for Geoheritage Management,"Fassoulas, C; Mouriki, D; Dimitriou-Nikolakis, P; Iliopoulos, G",208,"A quantitative methodology for the assessment of geotopes that can be used for the sustainable management and conservation of the geological heritage of an area is here presented. As sustainable development, education and conservation are core issues for the successful management of any protected area, this study focuses on the development of specific indexes necessary for determining values concerning the tourism, educational and protection requirements of geotopes. The proposed methodology is based on a series of criteria that cover not only the geological and geographical importance of a geotope but also its scientific, ecological, cultural, aesthetic and economic significance. Based on these criteria, the resulting scientific, ecological, cultural, aesthetic, economic and potential for use scores of each geotope are used to estimate, respectively, the touristic, educational and protection-need value indexes for each geotope on a scale ranging from 1 to 10. This methodology was implemented and tested in two areas in the island of Crete, namely the Psiloritis Natural Park, a European and Global geopark, and the Lassithi Mountains, producing reliable results, which are in agreement with the geopark's activities and values. The proposed quantitative assessment method is, therefore, a useful tool. It serves the requirements for the adequate management and protection of geoheritage within a territory as it can reveal priorities for sustainable tourism development, including geotourism and educational tourism activities and the conservation of geotopes.",2012,GEOHERITAGE,greece,University of Crete; University of Crete; University of Patras
Progress and Trends in the Application of Google Earth and Google Earth Engine,"Zhao, Q; Yu, L; Li, XC; Peng, DL; Zhang, YG; Gong, P",201,"Earth system science has changed rapidly due to global environmental changes and the advent of Earth observation technology. Therefore, new tools are required to monitor, measure, analyze, evaluate, and model Earth observation data. Google Earth (GE) was officially launched by Google in 2005 as a geobrowser, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) was released in 2010 as a cloud computing platform with substantial computational capabilities. The use of these two tools or platforms in various applications, particularly as used by the remote sensing community, has developed rapidly. In this paper, we reviewed the applications and trends in the use of GE and GEE by analyzing peer-reviewed articles, dating up to January 2021, in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection using scientometric analysis (i.e., by using CiteSpace) and meta-analysis. We found the following: (1) the number of articles describing the use of GE or GEE increased substantially from two in 2006 to 530 in 2020. The number of GEE articles increased much faster than those concerned with the use of GE. (2) Both GE and GEE were extensively used by the remote sensing community as multidisciplinary tools. GE articles covered a broader range of research areas (e.g., biology, education, disease and health, economic, and information science) and appeared in a broader range of journals than those concerned with the use of GEE. (3) GE and GEE shared similar keywords (e.g., land cover, water, model, vegetation, and forest), which indicates that their application is of great importance in certain research areas. The main difference was that articles describing the use of GE emphasized its use as a visual display platform, while those concerned with GEE placed more emphasis on big data and time-series analysis. (4) Most applications of GE and GEE were undertaken in countries, such as the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. (5) GEE is an important tool for analysis, whereas GE is used as an auxiliary tool for visualization. Finally, in this paper, the merits and limitations of GE and GEE, and recommendations for further improvements, are summarized from an Earth system science perspective.",2021,REMOTE SENSING,china,"Nanjing University; Tsinghua University; China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Aerospace Information Research Institute, CAS; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong"
Geodiversity and the ecosystem approach: the contribution of geoscience in delivering integrated environmental management,"Gray, M; Gordon, JE; Brown, EJ",201,"As reflected in the ecosystem approach, conservation strategies for the natural environment are responding to society's needs and the changing climate. Ecosystem assessments, particularly the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, have reviewed the benefits that society gains from the natural environment, but they under-represent and undervalue the contribution of geodiversity. Geodiversity underpins and delivers many vital ecosystem services, informs their management and is an important element of natural capital. This includes the application of knowledge of physical processes and evidence from Quaternary archives of recent environmental change to help future-proof ecosystems and their services. Key principles include working with natural processes, based on understanding their spatial and temporal dynamics, and adopting where possible soft engineering practices to enable multiple benefits for nature and society. The ecosystem approach and the need for climate change adaptation require more integrated approaches to geodiversity, biodiversity and landscape conservation and management to enable a more sustainable future. Engaging with these issues will also demonstrate the wider relevance today of geodiversity and geoconservation. Contributing successfully in these critical areas requires closer partnership working, both across the geoscience and geoconservation communities, and with other sectors of nature conservation, policy makers, planners and communities, as well as other disciplines. Geoscience has an essential contribution to make in addressing knowledge gaps recognised in ecosystem assessment and in implementing robust solutions to broader environmental, economic and social issues.

Why geodiversity matters in valuing nature's stage,"Hjort, J; Gordon, JE; Gray, M; Hunter, ML",194,"Geodiversitythe variability of Earth's surface materials, forms, and physical processesis an integral part of nature and crucial for sustaining ecosystems and their services. It provides the substrates, landform mosaics, and dynamic physical processes for habitat development and maintenance. By determining the heterogeneity of the physical environment in conjunction with climate interactions, geodiversity has a crucial influence on biodiversity across a wide range of scales. From a literature review, we identified the diverse values of geodiversity; examined examples of the dependencies of biodiversity on geodiversity at a site-specific scale (for geosites <1 km(2) in area); and evaluated various human-induced threats to geosites and geodiversity. We found that geosites are important to biodiversity because they often support rare or unique biota adapted to distinctive environmental conditions or create a diversity of microenvironments that enhance species richness. Conservation of geodiversity in the face of a range of threats is critical both for effective management of nature's stage and for its own particular values. This requires approaches to nature conservation that integrate climate, biodiversity, and geodiversity at all spatial scales.

Proporciona los sustratos, los mosaicos de accidentes geograficos y los procesos fisicos dinamicos para el desarrollo y mantenimiento de los habitats. Al determinar la heterogeneidad del ambiente fisico en conjunto con las interacciones del clima, la geodiversidad ha sido una influencia importante sobre la biodiversidad a traves de una gama amplia de escalas. A partir de una revision bibliografica, identificamos los valores diversos de la geodiversidad; examinamos ejemplos de las dependencias de la biodiversidad hacia la geodiversidad en una escala especifica de sitio (para geositios < 1 Km(2) de area); y evaluamos varias amenazas inducidas por humanos para los geositios y la geodiversidad. Encontramos que los geositios son importantes para la biodiversidad ya que generalmente mantienen una biota rara o unica, la cual esta adaptada a condiciones ambientales caracteristicas o la cual crea una diversidad de microambientes que mejoran la riqueza de especies. La conservacion de la geodiversidad de cara a una gama de amenazas es critica tanto para el manejo efectivo del estado de la naturaleza como para sus propios valores particulares. Esto requiere de enfoques para la conservacion de la naturaleza que integran al clima, a la biodiversidad y a la geodiversidad en todas las escalas espaciales.

Past climatic change and geological events have impacted the evolution and diversification of this biodiversity. During the last two decades, around 90 dated molecular phylogenies of different clades across animals and plants have been published leading to an increased understanding of the diversification and speciation processes generating tropical African biodiversity. In parallel, extended geological and palaeoclimatic records together with detailed numerical simulations have refined our understanding of past geological and climatic changes in Africa. To date, these important advances have not been reviewed within a common framework. Here, we critically review and synthesize African climate, tectonics and terrestrial biodiversity evolution throughout the Cenozoic to the mid-Pleistocene, drawing on recent advances in Earth and life sciences. We first review six major geo-climatic periods defining tropical African biodiversity diversification by synthesizing 89 dated molecular phylogeny studies. Two major geo-climatic factors impacting the diversification of the sub-Saharan biota are highlighted. First, Africa underwent numerous climatic fluctuations at ancient and more recent timescales, with tectonic, greenhouse gas, and orbital forcing stimulating diversification. Second, increased aridification since the Late Eocene led to important extinction events, but also provided unique diversification opportunities shaping the current tropical African biodiversity landscape. We then review diversification studies of tropical terrestrial animal and plant clades and discuss three major models of speciation: (i) geographic speciationviavicariance (allopatry); (ii) ecological speciation impacted by climate and geological changes, and (iii) genomic speciationviagenome duplication. Geographic speciation has been the most widely documented to date and is a common speciation model across tropical Africa. We conclude with four important challenges faced by tropical African biodiversity research: (i) to increase knowledge by gathering basic and fundamental biodiversity information; (ii) to improve modelling of African geophysical evolution throughout the Cenozoicviabetter constraints and downscaling approaches; (iii) to increase the precision of phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular dating of tropical African clades by using next generation sequencing approaches together with better fossil calibrations; (iv) finally, as done here, to integrate data better from Earth and life sciences by focusing on the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of tropical African biodiversity in a wider geodiversity context.",2021,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,france,Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Aarhus University; Aarhus University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Yaounde I; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Missouri Botanical Gardens; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; Naturalis Biodiversity Center; South African National Biodiversity Institute; University of Witwatersrand; Sorbonne Universite; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Cite; Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Universite PSL; College de France; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Cite; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)
The European Geoparks Network - Geological heritage protection and local development,"Zouros, N",192,"The European Geoparks Network was established in June 2000 by four regions of different European Countries-France, Germany, Spain and Greece-with similar natural and socioeconomic characteristics. These four regions are rural areas, with a particular geological heritage, natural beauty and high cultural potential, all facing problems of slow economic development, unemployment and a high level of emigration. Faced with these problems, the managing authorities of the geological parks and museums in these regions have decided to strengthen their collaboration, and as a result the European Geoparks Network has been established. Its main objective is to cooperate on the protection of the geological heritage and the promotion of sustainable development in their territories. The European Geoparks Network was built up with the support of the European Union initiatives. The founding members of the European Geoparks Network are: Reserve Geologique de Haute-Provence-France, The Petrified Forest of Lesvos (Natural History Museum of the Lesvos Petrified Forest, Island of Lesvos)-Greece, Geopark Gerolstein/Vulkaneifel-Germany and Maestrazgo Cultural Park-Spain.

Styles of back-arc extension in the Central Mediterranean,"Faccenna, C; Mattei, M; Funiciello, R; Jolivet, L",189,"In the Central Mediterranean two back-are basins, the Liguro-Provencal (LPb) and the Tyrrhenian basin (Tb), opened progressively and consecutively from the late Eocene-Oligocene to the present. Evolution in space and time of rifting and drifting processes, along three different transects across these basins, shows differences in the style of extension: LPb opened with the formation of a narrow, single rift, while in the ib deformation and magmatism is spread over a wide area, Moreover at the Northern end of the Tb the locus of extension progressively migrated towards the east whereas in the Southern Tb the locus of extension and magmatism migrated inside the basin, inducing continental break-up and drifting of the previously formed older conjugate basins. We propose that these different styles of back-are extension depend upon internal conditions, such as prerift rheology linked with its geological heritage, and external conditions, e.g. the style of subduction.",1997,TERRA NOVA,italy,CY Cergy Paris Universite

The partial indexes represent the main components of geodiversity, including geology (stratigraphy and lithology), geomorphology, paleontology, and soils. The fifth partial index covers mineral occurrences of geodiversity, such precious stones and metals, energy and industrial minerals, mineral waters, and springs.

Sites of geological and geomorphological interest have been appreciated for a long time, and from the nineteenth century, some have been declared as protected. The first official list of protected sites was created during the 1930s, and in 1956, the first law on nature conservation was approved. Today, nature conservation is covered by the Act 114/1992 Coll. that enables landscapes, karst features, minerals, and fossils to be protected as well as the establishment of protected areas. In addition, there are many other geoconservation assessments, e.g., the database of the geological sites or the network of the national geoparks. In the National Parks, Protected Landscape Areas or geoparks, the promotion of geosites and geomorphosites is well developed. However, outside these areas, the promotion and use of sites for geotourism purposes is relatively poor, although it is obvious that they can represent a source for geotourism activities that can foster local economic development. For finding out which sites are suitable for geotourism development, a simple method was proposed and the selected sites of the Vizovicka vrchovina Highland (Czech Republic) were assessed. Based on this, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats were identified. The assessment and the following analysis of the area can serve as a basis for the future proposals for geotourist use of the sites.",2016,GEOHERITAGE,republic,Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geonics of the Czech Academy of Sciences
Geographic patterns of vascular plant diversity at continental to global scales,"Barthlott, W; Hostert, A; Kier, G; Koper, W; Kreft, H; Mutke, J; Rafiqpoor, MD; Sommer, JH",141,"Documenting and understanding patterns of biodiversity is a central issue in biogeography and macroecology. Knowledge about the distribution of biodiversity is also a central prerequisite for its sustainable use and conservation. Due to a greater availability of distribution data, methodological advances, and software tools, important progress has been made during the last decade to map broad-scale geographic gradients of plant species richness and endemism at continental to global scales. In this paper, we provide an overview about recent advances made in this field. We present studies that analyze global-scale diversity patterns of gymnosperms and all vascular plants. Exemplarily for the model continent Africa, we show how biogeographic data can be used to develop broad-scale conservation strategies.",2007,ERDKUNDE,,
GemPy 1.0: open-source stochastic geological modeling and inversion,"de la Varga, M; Schaaf, A; Wellmann, F",134,"The representation of subsurface structures is an essential aspect of a wide variety of geoscientific investigations and applications, ranging from geofluid reservoir studies, over raw material investigations, to geosequestration, as well as many branches of geoscientific research and applications in geological surveys. A wide range of methods exist to generate geological models. However, the powerful methods are behind a paywall in expensive commercial packages. We present here a full open-source geomodeling method, based on an implicit potential-field interpolation approach. The interpolation algorithm is comparable to implementations in commercial packages and capable of constructing complex full 3-D geological models, including fault networks, fault-surface interactions, unconformities and dome structures. This algorithm is implemented in the programming language Python, making use of a highly efficient underlying library for efficient code generation (Theano) that enables a direct execution on GPUs. The functionality can be separated into the core aspects required to generate 3-D geological models and additional assets for advanced scientific investigations. These assets provide the full power behind our approach, as they enable the link to machine-learning and Bayesian inference frameworks and thus a path to stochastic geological modeling and inversions. In addition, we provide methods to analyze model topology and to compute gravity fields on the basis of the geological models and assigned density values. In summary, we provide a basis for open scientific research using geological models, with the aim to foster reproducible research in the field of geomodeling.",2019,GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT,germany,RWTH Aachen University

Geotourism - A geographical review of the literature,"Ruban, DA",125,"Geological tourism(geotourism) is a global activity that represents an important research direction. The latter is very young, but has spread rapidly since the 2000s. The geographical pattern of geotourism research can be examined through a bibliographical survey. A total of 165 journal articles were selected on geotourism published by 417 specialists from 45 countries during the 2012-2014 term. Authors' affiliations and the focus of regional research were analyzed. The results demonstrate that geotourism research concentrates in Europe, East Asia, the Middle East, and South America. The largest research communities are active in Italy, Brazil, China, and Poland. Overall, geotourism studies are conducted on all continents (except for Antarctica). The results demonstrate the global scale of geotourism research. The spread of this concept also is shown by the evidence of the growth of national and international networks of specialists. There is no good explanation for the documented world distribution of geotourism research that can be fully confirmed. Such an outcome implies that the geographical pattern of this rising scientific discipline is determined by a set of puzzling factors that may be equally important. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The edaphic control of plant diversity,"Hulshof, CM; Spasojevic, MJ",115,"Background The central thesis of plant ecology is that climate determines the global distribution of vegetation. Within a vegetation type, however, finer-scale environmental features, such as the physical and chemical properties of soil (edaphic variation), control patterns of plant diversity and distributions. Aims Here, we review the literature to provide a mechanistic framework for the edaphic control of plant diversity. First, we review three examples where soils have known, prevalent effects on plant diversity: during soil formation, on unusual soils and in regions with high edaphic heterogeneity. Second, we synthesize how edaphic factors mediate the relative importance of the four key processes of community assembly (speciation, ecological drift, dispersal and niche selection). Third, we review the potential effects of climate change in edaphically heterogeneous regions. Finally, we outline key knowledge gaps for understanding the edaphic control of plant diversity. In our review, we emphasize floras of unusual edaphic areas (i.e., serpentine, limestone, granite), because these areas contribute disproportionately to the biodiversity hotspots of the world. Taxa Terrestrial plants. Location Global. Conclusion Edaphic variation is a key driver of biodiversity patterns and influences the relative importance of speciation, dispersal, ecological drift, niche selection and interactions among these processes. Research is still needed to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which edaphic variation influences these community assembly processes, and unusual soils provide excellent natural systems for such tests. Furthermore, the incorporation of edaphic variation into climate change research will help to increase the predictive power of species distribution models, identify potential climate refugia and identify species with adaptations that buffer them from climate change.",2020,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,usa,Virginia Commonwealth University; University of California System; University of California Riverside
Our rich and varied geoconservation portfolio: the foundation for the future,"Prosser, CD",114,"Geodiversity, the natural range of geological, geomorphological and soil features and processes, is an integral part of the natural environment, as geoconservation is an integral part of nature conservation. Over the last sixty years, and especially since 1990, a substantial portfolio of geoconservation sites, legislation, partnerships and initiatives has developed within the UK and internationally. This includes local, national and international geoconservation audits, suites of protected sites such as Local Geological Sites, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Global Geoparks and World Heritage Sites, geoconservation legislation, policies, frameworks and guidance, partnerships, groups, societies and associations, periodicals and magazines, regular conferences and examples of success in securing funding for a range of geoconservation activities. This portfolio is an extremely valuable resource for science and society, creating opportunities for research, education, training, and recreation and providing 'windows' through which to study and understand past environmental change and thus inform planning to accommodate future change. The current social, economic and environmental context means that the approach to geoconservation must evolve to embrace new challenges and opportunities including the ecosystem approach, adapting to climate change, increasing the relevance of geodiversity to local communities and operating in a financially constrained environment. The future of geoconservation will depend upon innovation and full engagement with new opportunities, but in so doing, it is essential to maintain and build upon, rather than cast aside, the existing hard-won portfolio of sites, legislation, partnerships and initiatives as it provides the foundation from which to build the future of geoconservation.

Engaging with geodiversity-why it matters,"Gordon, JE; Barron, HF; Hansom, JD; Thomas, MF",114,"The Conference, 'Engaging with Geodiversity-Why it Matters', December 2010, addressed the wider relevance of geodiversity in Scotland. A key challenge is to integrate geodiversity within existing policy relating to the way we work and live, and therefore to inform better the decisions we make about a sustainable future for our environment. This will require partnership working among the geoscience, geoconservation and voluntary sectors at both national and local levels, not only to demonstrate convincingly the economic, social, cultural and environmental values and benefits of geodiversity, but also to deliver real outcomes for both people and nature. The key drivers that provide particular opportunities, as well as challenges, for the integration of geodiversity are the development of an ecosystem approach and how society responds to climate change. Addressing these will be crucial from a geoconservation perspective to develop a wider understanding of the essential environmental role played by geodiversity and for the protection of key sites, both from a policy perspective in delivering economic, social and environmental benefits, and from an academic perspective in ensuring support for geoscience. The key message - that geodiversity matters - must be communicated strongly to the highest levels of government, among key interest groups and at a local community level.

Assessing regional geodiversity: the Iberian Peninsula,"Benito-Calvo, A; Pérez-González, A; Magri, O; Meza, P",112,"Geodiversity is a landscape characteristic related to the heterogeneity of the physical properties of the earth surface. in this work, we quantify and compare geodiversity in several geodynamic zones of the Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose, we have developed a geographic information system (GIS) procedure to carry out a regional terrain classification based on geodiversity factors. A classification process helped to produce a morphometric map (10 classes), a morphoclimatic map (five classes) and a geological map (15 classes). These three maps were combined using an overlay operation (union) to obtain the final terrain classification (419 classes), which was then applied to calculate diversity landscape indices. The latter were calculated using common landscape diversity indices (Patch Richness Density, Shannon's Diversity Index, Shannon's Evenness Index, Simpson's Diversity Index and Simpson's Evenness Index), provided by FRAGSTATS free software. These indices were calculated for the whole landscape of the main Iberian geological regions, thus revealing a close relationship between some index values and the geological and geomorphological characteristics. The highest diversity values are associated with Alpine collisional orogens and reactivated chains of the Precambrian-Palaeozoic massif. Intraplate orogen with sedimentary cover, characterized by extensive planation surfaces, have lower values. Mesozoic areas with no significant tectonic deformation and Cenozoic basins are characterized by the lowest diversity values. Amongst the latter, the major diversity is associated with the most dissected basins, which also present higher morphoclimatic variety. Though depending on the chosen scale and the landscape classification criteria, these indices provide an objective assessment of the regional geodiversity of Iberia.

"Viewpoint geosites - values, conservation and management issues","Migon, P; Pijet-Migon, E",112,"Viewpoint geosites are a specific category of geosites, defined as locations which allow for unobstructed observation of the surrounding landscape and comprehension of Earth history recorded in rocks, structures and landforms visible from this locality. They have been poorly addressed in literature so far and this paper, primarily based on field observations and literature review, aims to discuss their significance and associated management and geoeducation issues. Viewpoint geosites do not necessarily have an intrinsic value related to geology or geomorphology but offer a view towards features and areas which do have such values. The role of a viewpoint geosite may be played by both natural features such as tors, crags, mountain tops, cliff edges, as well as by man-made structures erected intentionally to provide panoramic views and converted to play such a role. Paradoxically, although viewpoint geosites are the most suitable places to develop landscape interpretation, any interpretation facilities may severely interfere with the natural scenery, spoiling the aesthetic qualities of the landscape. Publications and mobile applications are alternative means to develop interpretation programmes. As other types of geosites, viewpoint geosites require management strategies that should focus on sustaining the view by periodic removal of vegetation if necessary, getting right balance between on-site facilities and scenic values, preventing soil erosion, and ensuring visitor safety.

On the relationship between a resource based measure of geodiversity and broad scale biodiversity patterns,"Parks, KE; Mulligan, M",111,"Geodiversity, (diversity of the geosphere) incorporates many of the environmental patterns and processes that are considered drivers of biodiversity. Components of geodiversity (climate, topography, geology and hydrology) can be considered in terms of their resource giving potential, where resources are taken as energy, water, space and nutrients. The total amount of these resources, along with their spatial and temporal variation, is herein proposed as a compound index of geodiversity that has the potential to model broad scale biodiversity patterns. This paper outlines potential datasets that could be used to represent geodiversity, and then reviews the theoretical links between each element of the proposed compound index of geodiversity (overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources) and broad-scale patterns of biodiversity. Support for the influence of each of the elements of geodiversity on overall biodiversity patterns was found in the literature, although the majority of relevant research focuses on resource availability, particularly available energy. The links between temporal and spatial variation in resources and biodiversity have been less thoroughly investigated in the literature. For the most part, it was reported that overall resource availability, temporal variation and spatial variation in those resources do not act in isolation in terms of controlling biodiversity. Overall there are sufficient datasets to calculate the proposed compound index of geodiversity, and evidence in the literature for links between the geographical distribution of biodiversity and each of the elements of the compound index defined. Since data for measuring geodiversity is more spatially consistent and widely available (thanks to satellite remote sensing) geodiversity has potential as a conservation planning tool, especially where biological data are not available or sparsely distributed.",2010,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,england,University of London; King's College London

Geodiversity of high-latitude landscapes in northern Finland,"Hjort, J; Luoto, M",107,"Geodiversity is a rather new, emerging topic in earth science. There is now increased awareness of our need to understand patterns of geodiversity in different landscapes facing global change. In this study, we systematically inventoried geodiversity and topographical parameters in an area of 285 km(2) in subarctic Finland. We quantified the spatial variation of geodiversity using four different measures and analysed the relationship between geodiversity and topography using a spatial grid system at a landscape scale (the size of the analysis window was 500 x 500 m). The number of different elements of geodiversity (total geodiversity) varied from 2 to 22 per grid cell. The spatial pattern of the total geodiversity, geomorphological process variability and geodiversity index were fairly similar, whereas of the other geodiversity measures, the measure of temporal diversity differed the most. Topographically, the high-diversity sites occurred in rather steep-sided valleys. Areas of high geodiversity reflect heterogeneous abiotic conditions where both erosion and accumulation processes play a major role in landscape development. The mapping of geodiversity may be indicative not only in the context of geomorphology, but also provide a focus for conservation initiatives. From a conservation point of view, the lack of wider knowledge of the distribution of geodiversity and its relationship to biodiversity hinders the protection of ecologically and geomorphologically valuable regions. Thus, we recommend that further studies focus on: (1) quantifying spatial patterns of geodiversity in different regions, (2) determining the key drivers that control the variability of geodiversity and (3) exploring the linkage between geodiversity and biodiversity.

Origins of global mountain plant biodiversity: Testing the 'mountain-geobiodiversity hypothesis',"Muellner-Riehl, AN; Schnitzler, J; Kissling, WD; Mosbrugger, V; Rijsdijk, KF; Seijmonsbergen, AC; Versteegh, H; Favre, A",107,"Aim Our objective is to analyse global-scale patterns of mountain biodiversity and the driving forces leading to the observed patterns. More specifically, we test the 'mountain geobiodiversity hypothesis' (MGH) which is based on the assumption that it is not mountain-uplift alone which drives the evolution of mountain biodiversity, but rather the combination of geodiversity evolution and Neogene and Pleistocene climate changes. We address the following questions: (a) Do areas of high geodiversity and high biodiversity in mountains overlap, that is can mountain geodiversity predict mountain biodiversity? (b) What is the role of Pleistocene climate change in shaping mountain biodiversity? (c) Did diversification rate shifts occur predominantly with the onset of more pronounced climate fluctuations in the late Neogene and Pleistocene fostering a 'species pump' effect, as predicted by the MGH? Location Global. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We used generalized linear models to test to what extent vascular plant species diversity in mountains is explained by net primary productivity (NPP), geodiversity and Pleistocene climate fluctuations (i.e. changes in temperature between the Last Glacial Maximum [LGM] and today). In addition, we compiled dates of diversification rate shifts from mountain systems and investigated whether these shifts occurred predominantly before or after the global major climatic fluctuations of the late Neogene and Pleistocene. Results Both NPP and elevation range show a positive relationship, whereas Pleistocene climatic fluctuations show a negative impact on plant species diversity. The availability of climatic niche space during the LGM differs markedly among mountain systems. Shifts to higher diversification rates or starts of radiations showed the highest concentration from the late Miocene towards the Pleistocene, supporting the MGH. The most commonly inferred drivers of diversification were key innovations, geological processes (uplift) and climate. Main conclusions Our analyses point towards an important role of historical factors on mountain plant species richness. Mountain systems characterized by small elevational ranges and strong modifications of temperature profiles appear to harbour fewer radiations, and fewer species. In contrast, mountain systems with the largest elevational ranges and stronger overlap between today ' s and LGM temperature profiles are also those where most plant radiations and highest species numbers were identified.",2019,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,germany,Leipzig University; German Research Foundation (DFG); German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv); University of Amsterdam; Leibniz Association; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN); Leibniz Association; Senckenberg Gesellschaft fur Naturforschung (SGN)
Defining the Nature and Purpose of Modern Geotourism with Particular Reference to the United Kingdom and South-East Europe,"Hose, TA; Vasiljevic, DA",107,"This paper presents an overview of the original United Kingdom development, definition of, and approach to modern geotourism. That approach had geoconservation and geo-interpretation as its key underpinning elements and was incorporated within the initial UNESCO geopark documentation. Since the opening of the twenty-first century, several agencies and authors have adopted a non-geoconservation, indeed sometimes a non-geological approach, to geotourism. Some of these misguided approaches permeate aspects of geotourism provision and management within protected and promoted landscapes such as some national parks and geoparks; thus, it is opportune to reaffirm geotourism's original rationale and approach. This paper necessarily examines and critiques the geotourism concept from its initial definition in the United Kingdom to the development of newer redefinitions and the present plethora of often contradictory and confusing approaches. It provides numerous historical and contemporary examples to underpin the discussion. Several geotourism models have already been developed but the rapid expansion of the geotourism literature indicates the need for their further refinement; hence, a revised geotourism definition together with a revised model is proffered. Finally, it summarises the ongoing impact of the original modern geotourism approach and its future application within Europe.",2012,GEOHERITAGE,england,University of Bristol; University of Novi Sad

Geoheritage and geodiversity management - the questions for tomorrow,"Erikstad, L",101,"Geodiversity is an important term for future geoheritage management strategies. It is modelled on the term biodiversity that today dominates the work of nature conservation. It describes a complexity of natural attributes in all scales and represents both opportunities and challenges for management strategies. Drawing on experience of geoconservation from across Europe this article focusses on three major issues important to the future geoheritage work: (1) geodiversity as a comprehensive framework for management, (2) the importance of legislation and strategies and (3) practical conservation, management and land use. In focussing on thee issues it should not be forgotten however that the very need for conservation of the geological heritage is still not well developed and accepted in many countries and needs to be promoted as a priority. It is argued here that the term geodiversity should be used flexibly to retain relevance across different aspects of geoscience, natural terrains, countries and aspects. Cooperation between institutions and countries is necessary to maintain and develop geoconservation strategies and should be given higher priority, defined scientifically to promote the scientific and educational status, promoted and shared internationally. National legislation is also very important and should be backed by international conventions and international organisations. In Europe geoheritage, geoconservation and geodiversity should be accepted as EU policy and integrated into EU directives. (C) 2012 The Geologists' Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Susceptibility assessment of landslides triggered by earthquakes in the Western Sichuan Plateau,"Cao, J; Zhang, Z; Wang, CZ; Liu, JF; Zhang, LL",101,"Seismic landslides are the most harmful natural events in mountainous areas worldwide. They are secondary disasters triggered by earthquakes and can cause a great number of casualties and significant damage to infrastructure. Three areas, Wenchuan, Lushan and Jiuzhaigou, which are highly prone to seismic landslides, were selected for this study. The aim of this study is to compare the prediction accuracy and spatial generalization ability of the logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models in seismic landslide susceptibility mapping. First, using the LR and RF techniques, the susceptibility models of seismic landslides were developed in Wenchuan and Lushan based on thirteen influencing factors. Then, the accuracy of the susceptibility mapping was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results showed that both RF models have excellent prediction capability and strong robustness over large areas compared with the LR models. The AUC values of the RF and LR models were 0.811 vs. 0.946 and 0.905 vs. 0.969 in Wenchuan and Lushan, respectively. Second, we used the seismic landslides of Wenchuan and Lushan to develop the better model (RF), and then applied the developed RF model to produce the landslide susceptibility mapping of Jiuzhaigou County. The prediction accuracy for Jiuzhaigou dropped to 0.704. The results show that the RF model developed in Wenchuan and Lushan has robustness and spatial generalization ability over large areas. However, many landslides that had not been identified by the model, were located in the scenic area of Jiuzhaigou, a popular tourist destination. This suggests that intensive human activities could increase the landslide susceptibility. Thus, we added a new factor related to tourism to produce an improved RF model. The prediction accuracy of the altered model improved significantly, with the AUC value rising from 0.704 to 0.987. Thus, human engineering activities have a significant impact on landslides. Our study indicates that human engineering activities can increase the likelihood of landslides; hence, human engineering activities related to tourism should not be neglected in landslide susceptibility research.

Paleogeography as geological heritage: Developing geosite classification,"Bruno, DE; Crowley, BE; Gutak, JM; Moroni, A; Nazarenko, OV; Oheim, KB; Ruban, DA; Tiess, G; Zorina, SO",100,"Geological heritage sites (geosites) are sites that contain information about the state and the dynamics of the Earth. Paleogeographical (paleoenvironmental) geosites preserve paleoenvironments, paleoecosystems, and other relevant phenomena. However, the value of these sites can only be fully understood through professional interpretation of the observed features. Description of paleogeographical geosites in terms of the paleospace and the geologic time they encompass is challenging, partially because of many uncertainties in the interpretations of a given geosite and in the paleogeographical, paleobiogeographical, and stratigraphical nomenclature. These geosites can be classified on the basis of fad, paleoecosystems, ichnological value, taphonomic patterns, major events and catastrophes, and geoarcheological potential that they exhibit. Some geosites comprise several subtypes, and some are especially important for construction of paleogeographical maps. Moreover, the paleogeographical geosite type always associates with other types of geosites (20 in total). These combinations form complex geosites that contribute to geodiversity. If information about the Earth's past is especially valuable for a given complex geosite, then the paleogeographical type is dominant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A Statistical Approach to the Validation and Optimisation of Geoheritage Assessment Procedures,"Bruschi, VM; Cendrero, A; Albertos, JAC",99,"The assessment of geoheritage is a crucial task for the establishment of ranks according to their value, an important step for the elaboration of catalogues and the implementation of protection and use programmes. One important problem that permeates the different stages of geoheritage assessment is subjectivity in the selection and application of criteria. Evaluation methods frequently used are based on the assignment of values through the expert's judgement (direct methods). In the last few decades, parametric methods, based on the measurement of specific features of geomorphosites have been increasingly applied. This type of procedure allows different operators to obtain similar results if certain criteria are accepted, but it requires more time and effort. A parametric method is proposed here based on three sets of criteria: intrinsic quality, potential for use and protection needs. The method has been tested on a series of coastal geomorphosites. Specific criteria, parameters to express them and value ranks are proposed. A statistical approach has been applied to the criteria to identify the most significant ones and their relative weights. The analysis enabled reduction of the number of criteria, eliminating redundancies. The new set of criteria was applied to assess the value of geomorphosites located in the north of Spain. The classification was compared with the ones obtained by both the parametric method using a larger number of parameters and a direct evaluation applied to the same sites. Results show a quite good coincidence. It is concluded that this approach makes it possible to obtain reliable classifications of geomorphosites based on clearly defined criteria and replicable procedures, but with a much lower effort, using a limited number of criteria.",2011,GEOHERITAGE,spain,Universidad de Cantabria; Universidad de Cantabria
Inclusion of explicit measures of geodiversity improve biodiversity models in a boreal landscape,"Hjort, J; Heikkinen, RK; Luoto, M",94,"Measures of geodiversity may provide a potentially useful surrogate for biodiversity patterns in insufficiently surveyed areas. However, their reliability in modelling the spatial variation in species richness is inadequately understood. We investigated whether the explanatory and predictive power of species richness models can be improved by considering explicit measures of geodiversity (variability of earth surface materials, forms and processes) in addition to climate and topography variables. Vascular plant species richness was modelled in two study areas in Northern Europe, Finland at the resolution of 500 or 1000 m, and as a function of three geodiversity (geological, geomorphological and hydrological diversity) variables, and six climate and topography variables. Variation partitioning was used to identify the independent and shared contributions of the geodiversity, climate and topography variable groups in explaining the spatial patterns of species richness. Generalized additive models were used to explore the ability of the different explanatory variables in predicting plant species richness within and between the study areas. In both the study areas, the inclusion of measures of geodiversity improved the explanatory power, predictive ability and robustness of the plant species richness models. In conclusion, the explicit measures of geodiversity appear to be promising surrogates of biodiversity, which reflect important abiotic resource factors, and may thus provide an equally, or even more reliable basis for transferring biodiversity models to new areas than models based on climate and topography variables.",2012,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,finland,University of Oulu; Finnish Environment Institute; University of Helsinki
Geotourism in Volcanic and Geothermal Environments: Playing with Fire?,"Erfurt-Cooper, P",94,"Volcanic and geothermal landforms have unique features which make them attractive destinations for geotourism, ecotourism and adventure tourism. Vast numbers of volcanic environments worldwide combined with a special geodiversity offer an extensive range of outdoor activities including the opportunity for education about geoheritage as well as an insight into their significant value for regional culture, religion and history. The importance of volcanic and geothermal environments for the tourism sector has been recognised with the development of volcano-based National Parks and more recently, National and Global Geoparks where geomorphosites containing volcanoes which are currently active and volcanoes classed as active due to their past activity during the Holocene as well as geothermal landscapes are promoted as tourist attractions. Given the growing popularity of volcanic and geothermal destinations, it is paramount that management authorities make visits to active environments as safe as possible. To date, there is a paucity of publications in the academic literature on risk management in volcano and geothermal tourism. This article aims to contribute to closing this gap in the tourism literature.",2011,GEOHERITAGE,australia,James Cook University
